  Hi, Iâ€™m Sendy!
  I'm a software engineer, I like to make stuffs and experimenting with them.
  Right now I'm interested in Haskell and Swift.
  I write code for <a href="https://cermati.com" target="_blank">Cermati</a>
  and contribute to open source on
  <a href="https://github.com/sendyhalim" target="_blank">Github</a>.
  Poke me if you have interesting projects!
