I'm Sendy Halim 👋. I live in Tangerang, Indonesia with my wife, one child, and a dog.\nI'm passionate about software engineering, I randomly came across to it when I was looking for\na new hobby during my 1st semester of my accounting degree, I completed my major though.\n\n#\nAbout Software engineering\nWriting code and software engineering is a hobby to me, it's an activity that\nI enjoy the most. I'm not sure what's the reason, it's just I'm really into it.\nUnfortunately I rarely write code at work nowadays, I'm putting my focus to\nmanage teams of great software engineers, the low feeling of not writing code is paid half\neverytime the teams ship features and bring more value to users, the other half is paid\nwhen I write code in my sparetime 🤞.\n\n#\nAbout Blogging\nThere are a couple of reasons why I started this blog:\n\nI want to docment my thoughts based on my life, hobby projects, and profesional experience working in the software engineering field.\nI want to improve my writing skills.\n\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/pages/about-me/","title":"About Me"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/","title":""},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/development-practices/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/development-practices/","title":""},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/development-practices/partnership-system-integration-tips/":{"body":"Recently we just had intense integrations with our business partners.\nWe have a whitelabel product where registered whitelabel partners can use our core engine\nand put their brand as the label.\n\n  \n\nThe development was very intense because there are some parts that need to be customized\nfor each partners and some of the APIs are not even 100% finished yet. We do the development both ways,\npartners also allocated engineering resource on their side to help with the integration.\nDuring this intense moment, we made some mistakes, both engineering related and non engineering.\nThis post is about the lessons/key takeaways from the experience.\nI'll update the post regularly as the learning process continues, stay tuned!\n\n\n#\nUnix timestamp for all datetime API parameters\nAs of now we're using iso datetime format\nfor datetime fields, it's very likely that your API clients are using a different\nprogramming language / library and the tool that they choose is going to behave differently.\nAt the end unixtimestamp is the most general way to pass datetime data.\n\n#\nsnake_case instead of camelCase for API fields\nWe had multiple integration problems when partners had typo. Let's face it,\neveryone has this experience where you mistype the camelCase format,\ne.g. someField -&gt; somefield. Using snake_case should reduce the possibility\nof the problem thus would save your client's time and your time when doing integration.\n\n#\nUse \"sprint\" as the development estimation time unit\nThere will be times where both parties agrees on to develop new features, depending on the urgency,\nif it's a not a critical feature then I'd advise to always use n sprint as the time estimation.\nThe new non-critical feature takes 4 hours to complete? Set the estimation to 1 sprint,\nif it takes &gt; 50% of sprint points then say it takes 2 sprints. Development is not just\nabout code-complete, it's about delivering the features that meet the expectation\nwith minimum bugs and 0 critical bug, probably you need to update your API docs too.\n\n#\nHandling major changes/decisions\nMake sure major changes/decisions will be discussed internally first, there will be different\npoint of views, from product, UI/UX, engineering. Anything related to the major decisions should be answered with Let us discuss internally first, we'll get back to you by X day(s)\n\n#\nRemember, it's a partnership\nThis is a partnership, it's a relationship where we will work together as a partner for\nmutual benefits, it's not a stage to throw mistakes, it's a stage to perform together\nand achieve great things together. Having this mindset will help your emotion and stress level in check.\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/development-practices/partnership-system-integration-tips/","title":"Partnership System Integration Tips"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/development-practices/practical-programming-principles/":{"body":"There are many programming paradigms, many approaches to code, new tools and frameworks, well things are moving fast 🏎 💨!\nI hope this post can be something to be held on when considering programming and development standard.\nUsually the considerations will be useful when starting a new project, when there are arguments on\nhow to approach things in development,, which tool/framework to use. Pick whatever you think is suitable for your project &amp; team, take it with a grain of salt.\nHaving these principles in mind has helped my team to:\n\nMake programming decisions: how to structure code, how to handle errors.\nDecide when should we opt-in for a hack and what's the minimum proper way to apply a \"quickfix\".\nDecide when to invest more in documentations.\n\n\n#\nReadability\nReadability means it's easy to understand, not just easy to read. Easy to understand meaning might vary\nbecause each company/team has different engineering skills standard due to different skillset requirements as well. Having a readability standard set earlier will boost\nteam productivity in the longer run, it'll cut communication cost, reduce the time needed to understand the code, hence improve the team onboarding process.\n\n#\n[Readability] Statically typed language\nIt might be worth the investment to use statically typed language. Code is meant to be read more than it is written,\nstatic typing will improve readability. The compiler will help you eliminate most of the compile-time type errors, which will simplify code reviews, unit testing.\nyou don't need to test data type unless your project requires you to do a lot of runtime type checking, too many runtime checking could be be sign of another problem though (depending on project goals).\n\n#\n[Readability] Invest in code comments\nCode comments can be used to explain \"why\" certain logic is set that way, this will cut communication cost and make debugging a lot easier.\nThe goal is to help your peers and \"future you\" to understand the code either in code review or when we want to revisit the code in the future. Cases where code comment is beneficial:\n\nComplex logic.\nMotivation regarding unorthodox approach.\nHack/quick fix, this would reduce confusion a lot and make it explicit that the approach that's considered a \"hack\" is intended.\n\n\n#\n[Readability] Standard on variable names\nSet an acceptable standard of explicitness with your team.\nOne of the most obvious example is to agree on how to name variables.\n\nUse plural for list, vector or array type.\n\nlet emails: Vec&lt;String&gt;;\nlet users: Vec&lt;User&gt;;\nlet people: Vec&lt;Person&gt;;\n\n\nUse {value}_by_{type} naming pattern for key-value data structure (hashmap, btreemap, dictionary, etc)\n\n// You'll get a user given an email\nlet userByEmail: HashMap&lt;String, User&gt;;\n\n// You'll get users given a name, maybe you're grouping users by their first name\nlet usersByFirstName: HashMap&lt;String, Vec&lt;User&gt;&gt;;\n\n\n#\n[Readability] Limit on maximum number of characters per line.\nImagine you're reading a book, you need to scroll both vertically &amp; horizontally\nto read a paragraph because there's no maximum number of characters per line,\nwould it be a good user experience? The same goes for writing code, imagine a line of code\nthat you need to scroll both directions a lot, wouldn't it be easier to just scroll vertically?\n\n#\nModularity\nModular means it's easy to plug &amp; change something because there's a balanced abstraction. Note that in practice, you do not have to abstract everything,\ntoo much abstraction would be make it less readable and harder to understand. It\nwould make the most sense to put abstraction on top of something that would likely to change or\nsomething that already has/will have multiple implementations.\nOne easy example: suppose we want to send\nSMS(maybe for MFA use cases - OTP) to our users, putting an interface on top of the actual vendor\nimplementation might be a good idea, why? Let's start with the business use case, MFA is a critical security feature, having a good OTP delivery rate is crucial for the user experience, we\ncan't rely only to 1 vendor, it's important to have at least another SMS vendor backup in case the the primary vendor is down or there are other problems (latency drops or the delivery rate drops).\nIf we put an interface for it, it's easy to switch. The switch strategy might vary, it could be via a circuit breaker mechanism or just a simple remote config to decide which SMS vendor to use.\nA bit intermezzo, use TOTP might be more secure than OTP.\nThere's a signal that you could use to measure modularity, if it's relatively easy\nto write unit tests then most probably your code is modular enough because it's easy\nto inject dependencies (mock objects in unit test context) and hence will make it easier to refactor things if needed.\n\n#\nError Handling\nSoftware breaks all the time, preferably you want to be able to spot errors before your users do.\nWhen you got error reports you also want to be able to debug it.\n\n#\n[Error Handling] Observability\nMake sure errors do not go into limbo, you want to be able to plot and gauge error rates over time.\nIt should be easy to spot as well.\n\nHow easy is it to be alerted when there are errors?\nCan you see the error logs? How easy is it to see it?\nDo we have a clear separation on what's considered an error? Do not log informational messages as error\n\n\n#\n[Error Handling] Debuggability\nThe easier it is to debug the error, the faster it is to resolve the problem, your time should be spent\nmostly on building products/software instead of debugging.\nSome of the key points to measure your debuggability:\n\nHow easy is it to prioritize errors? We should be able to separate errors by their severity, errors that block users to complete payment should be more important than errors related to the feature to change the username.\nError message, do we construct meaningful error messages? or is it just printing \"System Error\"?\n\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/development-practices/practical-programming-principles/","title":"Practical Programming Principles"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/development-practices/technical-design-doc-guidelines/":{"body":"Writing a technical design doc(TDD) is a prerequisite of a medium-high feature development/refactoring initiative, it's a crucial part of the development process.\nTDD can ease the process to get everyone on board with the plan, the doc should be reviewed by your CTO/Managers and stakeholders.\nIt's an essential part of the planning process because it brings people together, especially to get buy-in from the team and stakeholders so they can provide support along the way 🍪!\nThe post will cover some of the general guidelines that hopefully can assist you to prepare the TDD.\nThe main principle is simple just like writing code, the easier it is to understand the easier it is to review.\n\n#\nStart with background\nBackground section should help people understand the context of the document, generally you can show a high level\noverview of how certain problems are currently solved, how a certain feature works, etc.\nShowing an overview of the current state will help people understand the background a bit deeper, if there's a current implementation/flow then show it, and make it explicit what could be improved from the current flow.\nFeel free to put links to other existing docs as well. A diagram flow will help people to visualize and catch up quickly.\nFree tools that you can use:\n\ndiagrams.net\nMermaidJS\n\n\n#\nProblem statement\nThis section states the problem with the current state, it should emphasize the importance of solving that problem and show why it matters.\nSome key points that maybe can guide you:\n\nAre you solving a specific user problem where there are N users that are impacted?\nThe current process might have pain points and sometimes users are just numb to the \"pain\" up until someone points it out.\nWill it increase the company's business metric either directly or indirectly? If it can save cost, any estimation by what %?\nAre you investing for future needs? Why does that specific investment matter?\n\n\n#\nRequirements\nThe requirements section set boundaries on the solution, it helps you to filter solutions that can be applied.\nTypically there will be specific functionalities/features that the solutions must provide.\n\n#\nShow the available options/solutions that we have\nThere would be more than one solution that we can apply to meet the requirements, it's preferable to lay out the available options that we have.\nStart with the least preferable solution and list down its pros and cons, progressive move to the most preferable solution.\nMake it clear why we're implementing that specific solution, and why the others won't work as well as the one that you propose.\nShowing the available solutions will make it easier for us to get back here quickly just in case we pursued the wrong solution.\n\n#\nWhat are the success metrics\nDecide on the success metrics that can be monitored.\nFor example, if you're implementing a UX improvement, the success metric should be something related to the feature funnel, one thing that you could do is add trackers to the feature funnel and then query the data through an analytical database,\nor just reuse existing funnel dashboard (if any).\n\n#\nWhat are the action items &amp; timelines\nList all of the action items and set the PIC. PIC could be a team (the team lead will delegate the tasks) or an individual contributor.\nIf the project has milestones then set the deadline for each milestone, if it's not then it's ok to just put the end goal deadline,\nmake sure all the PICs agree with the timeline.\n\n#\nWhat's your backup plan\nThings could fail even with an almost perfect plan, what's your backup plan?\nIf a migration plan fails, what should we do? Is there a way to turn back? If there's a way, should we continue with the risk or is there anything that we should do?\nWhat are the steps of the backup plan? Who's going to execute it?\nSpecifically in product engineering, suppose it does not meet the deadline, then what are non-essential features that we can cut? Can we move them into the next iterations?\n\n#\nGather feedback\nThere's no perfect plan, open a feedback session and verify reviewers concerns. Sometimes there are blind spots due to the lack of visibility/outdated product knowledge,\nfor example the flow that you read has changed after you prepared the plan.\nDon't worry too much, that's why we're doing the technical design doc review session 🖖.\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/development-practices/technical-design-doc-guidelines/","title":"Technical Design Doc Guidelines"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/git/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/git/","title":""},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/git/phabricator-developing-feature-on-top-of-other-feature/":{"body":"NOTES: This post assumes that you're familiar with git rebase and phabricator terms.\nWe use phabricator as our code review tool. A typical workflow for submitting &amp; merging your feature:\n\nCreate a new feature branch based on master branch, develop and git commit locally from there.\nSubmit code review arc diff when we're done.\nRun arc land to merge our diff to remote master branch.\n\narc land will squash all of the commits into 1 commit on the feature branch, it uses diff title and description as the commit message. We can also simulate arc land manually, maybe not 100% exact though:\n\ngit checkout master to make sure local master branch is up to date.\ngit checkout &lt;feature-branch&gt;\ngit rebase master -i and squash all of the &lt;feature-branch&gt; commits into 1 commit on top of master branch.\nMerge the rebased &amp; squashed feature branch to remote master.\nCheckout to master and pull origin master.\n\nThis typical flow works if we work on separate features at the same time, but it could fail if we try to develop feature on top of other feature that's still in code review (submitted to phabricator). There are many cases this failure could happen, one of the frequent one is when we develop feature-b on top of feature-a where feature-a is still in code review.\n\n#\nSimulation\nWe'll be using this repo as example.\nAssumptions:\nM = master\nFA = feature a\nFB = feature b\n\nmx&lt;n&gt; = commit on master branch\nax&lt;n&gt; = commit on feature-a branch\nbx&lt;n&gt; = commit on feature-b branch\n\nThe condition will look like below:\n\nmaster branch: 3 commits mx1, mx2, and mx3.\nfeature-a branch: 2 commits ax1 and ax2.\nfeature-b branch: 3 commits bx1, bx2 and bx3, it's  built on top of feature-a.\n\nmx1---mx2---mx3---&gt; [M]\n               \\\n                ax1---ax2---&gt; [FA]\n                         \\\n                          bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\n\n#\nArc land feature-a branch\nLet's say that your feature-a is accepted via code review process and you do arc land, it'll squash commits ax1 and ax2 into 1 commit.\n# Process view\n# S = squash\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---&gt; [M]\n               \\         /---bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n                ax1---ax2---&gt; [FA]\n                 |     |\n                 S     S\n# End result\n# There's a new commit \"ax\" that represents commit ax1 and ax2.\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---ax---&gt; [M]\n               \\\n                ax1---ax2---bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\nfeature-b doesn't need ax1 and ax2 because it's already represented by ax. It will fail if you've submitted feature-b for code review and do arc land, the reason is because it could not merge \"cleanly\". The fix is actually pretty easy, you need to point commit bx1 to ax. We will do git rebase to rewrite the history, PLEASE BACKUP feature-b first before you do this, you can do it by checking-out out from feature-b to another branch.\ngit checkout feature-b\n\n# Backup for safety\ngit checkout -b feature-b-backup\n\n\n#\nRewriting history\nFirst, make sure that we're on feature-b and then we will run rebase interactive to drop commits ax1 and ax2.\nIt should be safe because both commits are already in master (represented by ax commit).\n# Do interactive rebase onto master\n# --------------------\ngit rebase -i master\n\nThere will be an editor prompt that should look like\npick 233a9b8 ax1\npick 5f5e3ce ax2\npick e145774 bx1\npick 1834f7d bx2\npick 95d155a bx3\n\nYou have 2 options remove ax1 and ax2:\n\nDelete the lines\nReplace pick with drop\n\nYou can do either one but I'll go with drop to make it more explicit in this post\ndrop 233a9b8 ax1\ndrop 5f5e3ce ax2\npick e145774 bx1\npick 1834f7d bx2\npick 95d155a bx3\n\nSave your changes and quit editor, the rebase process will continue by itself.\nNow your feature-b should point to the latest commit on local master branch, you can verify this via git log or use a GUI tool.\ngit log --oneline --decorate --color --graph\n\n# End result\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---ax---&gt; [M]\n                    \\\n                     bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\nThat's it, now you can do arc land cleanly. I hope it helps, wish there's an easier way.\n\n#\nPost Updates\nMost recent updates:\n\nGot feedback from Daniel Albert regarding the rebase process, we could use git rebase -i master to reduce confusion.

After some iterations, there's a noticeable common pattern in problem-solving and execution.\nUsing just instinct is actually ok, but having a structure would make it easier to document, distribute/share and extend the approach.\nProblem-solving structure is also useful in high-pressure situations to greatly reduce the chance of missing a step or two.\nNowadays, my default would be to try to structure everything, this applies in life not just in a work environment.\nI'm sharing what I currently have in mind regarding this, I hope this post can help you to structure executions and be more effective.\n\n#\nStructure in Problem Solving\n\n#\nInitial thoughts\nWe can set a structure for problem-solving approach, though it might differ for everyone because everyone has different problems with different patterns.\nJust for example, a simple problem-solving structure could look something like this:\n\nProblem background, we need to understand the context and the problem first, and make sure it actually exists, this can be done by reading user feedback, looking at the data, etc.\nProblem priority, the problem may exist but it's better if we evaluate whether it's worth it solving or not. After all, we already have many problems to solve right? If it's worth it then evaluate and set the problem priority.\nTypically we want to solve the higher priority problems first, starting with the easiest ones if there are problems with the same priorities.\nProblem delegation, suppose we decide to solve it, do we have the capacity? Can it be delegated?\nPlan for solution, is the problem quite common? Do we have existing solutions that we could use or should we formulate our own solution?\nExecution, just get it done.\nMonitoring, how do I know the problem is solved? Can we monitor the data?\n\n\n#\nDecompose the problem\nUnless it's straightforward, a problem typically can be decomposed into simpler subproblems. Those subproblems\nprobably can be broken down again, the depth depends on how big the problem is and how would you balance it.\nDecomposing a problem makes it easier to delegate and find a specific solution to the subproblems.\nTry to find the balance, if it's too small then probably we'll end up spending unnecessary time breaking it down instead of\nactually solving the problem, if it's too big then the execution might be suboptimal due to overwhelming assignment.\nWhat I find is, generally it's easier to break down problems based on the skillset required to solve them because it'll be easier to\ndelegate to a team/people of a specific role.\n\n#\nAttempts to apply structure on other cases\nWe're going to go through some examples outside of general problem-solving structure,\nwe will try to apply structure to each case. I encourage you to try to make your own examples at the end.\n\n#\nExample: Launching a new product\nSuppose we have evaluated that it's worth it to launch a new software product (a problem worth solving), the assignment structure could be divided into:\n\nProduct management -&gt; assign to the Product team\nUI &amp; flow component -&gt; assign to UI/UX team\nDevelopment component -&gt; assign to the Engineering team\nMarketing component -&gt; assign to the Marketing team\n\nEach of the team could break down the assignment into multiple subproblems until we\nthink it's quite optimal, the development team could divide development effort into:\n\nBackend Team\nAndroid Team\niOS Team\nEngineering Infra Team, maybe we need to spin more servers.\n\nFollowing up on the assignment structure, each team could have its own execution structure, it doesn't have to follow the same structure\nbecause the way to solve the subproblem could differ. Engineering teams typically use agile methodology meanwhile marketing might use other approaches.\n\n#\nExample: Covering to lead a meeting\nThere's a product-themed meeting coming soon, but the lead product manager that's supposed to lead the meeting was on sick leave on that day.\nI was asked to help lead the meeting since the other person that knows the high-level details was only me,\nI was kind of nervous because I'm more accustomed to leading engineering-themed meetings.\nPlease note I'm not talking about meeting structure, we already have it and we can just follow the usual meeting structure,\nbut my goal was to up my understanding and confidence level leading a product-themed meeting.\nLet's try to structure it:\n\nI think it's best to write down the meeting objectives first with our own sentences.\nThen break down what would be the key points/outline needed to be discussed to meet the objectives.\nTry to visualize how would the meeting run with the above key points.\n\n\n#\nExample: Going for a vacation\nI would like to have a vacation in Japan with my family, the top level structure to get to the goal would be:\n\nVacation dates\nItinerary\nBudget planning\n\nSame with other problems, we can break each point into subproblems/checklists, vacation dates could be broken down into:\n\nFind out the date ranges with low workload so we can have vacations stress free\nGet buy-in from family\nGet annual leave approval\n\nThe itinerary is probably the easiest to delegate, if I don't have time I'll just reuse itineraries made by other people.\n\n#\nKey takeaways\n\nNot every problem is worth solving, try to prioritize.\nWhen there’s a problem try to think about the problem structure first then break it down into subproblems until it's quite optimal, follow the structure and move towards the solution.\nIf it's too much for you, always consider delegating the subproblems, especially the ones that can be run in parallel.\nStructure can be applied in many cases.\n\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/life/setting-up-a-structure-on-problem-solving-and-life/","title":"Everything has a structure, thoughts on problem solving structure"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/reading-checklist/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/reading-checklist/","title":""},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/reading-checklist/postgresql/":{"body":"I'm not a database expert, in my career I've faced so many issues and bottlenecks,\nmost of the come from database.

I personally think there's too much noise on the learning path nowadays.\nA little bit of my background, I'm a self taught, I do software engineering for fun and I was lucky to land an engineering role at Cermati in 2015, so I’m confident that I can say a thing or two regarding getting into the software engineering field. I will write another post on the details of the journey, this post will focus on my version of balanced practical approach to get into the software engineering field.\nI hope this post can be useful as a guideline and inspiration for other people to get into the software engineering role.\n\n#\nLearning Keypoints\nIt's very common for everyone to have varying learning journeys, I think there are some important points to keep in mind regardless of your learning path:\n\nIt's a lot easier to pick a specific learning path if you know what you want. It ranges from wanting to build a tech startup, switching career to tech or just finding a new hobby.\nIf you just want to try things out whether software engineering fits you or not, then I would recommend finding a problem that you think can be solved with software. Typically, repetitive tedious tasks can be solved or automated by software, keep the problem in your mental notes so it's easier to relate to it during learning. Try to think whether it’s possible to solve your problem with your current tech skills, if not then try to find the missing learning components.\nFocus on the fundamentals. There are many engineering tools and frameworks, it's a common pattern to come across a \"new cool thing\" in software engineering. The tools you learn today could be obsolete anytime in the future, the fundamentals however typically can be applied to most of the tools. Be curious, always ask why? Why things work that way, why things are built that way.\nIt’s expected to not understand subjects from the learning source you're currently on, don’t give up yet! My tip is to search other learning sources on the same topic and try to learn from different perspectives, you can do it by googling or youtube or just asking ChatGPT, beware though it might not be 100% on point, you need to reverify the answer by re-reading the subject from other sources.\nI’m recommending to read books as your main learning source, it’s structured and easy to search by text. At the very minimum, books with 100+ reviews and 4.5+ stars on Amazon.com should be ok. Watching videos are ok but I think it’s hard to search for a specific explanation by keyword. You could also do bootcamps, but it seems most of them put more emphasis on the frameworks/tools instead of the fundamentals though.\nSoftware engineering is a craft, the more you put in the hours to write software the more you’ll get better.\n\n\n#\nLearning Path\nFollowing a balanced practical path throughout your journey is crucial, you want to know the fundamentals and be able to practically apply them. The fundamentals will set you apart and help you make better engineering decisions, for example, which tools (language, framework, libraries) to use and how to use them properly.\nThe learning path that I'm recommending might take ~12 months with dedication, around 1-2 hours per day on average, it consists of mainly 3 components:\n\nProgramming fundamentals, focusing on the basic programming concept as the foundation for you to build software.\nBuilding a website, I think it's a good idea to start with building a basic website UI, we will build the server side later on since most of tech products are connected to the internet.\nBuilding a web server, a web server is responsible to process, store, and serve user website data. Imagine a user registration functionality where users can input email and password, the data will be processed and stored on the web server side.\n\n\n#\nProgramming Fundamentals\n\n#\nWhy\nProgramming fundamentals can be applied to most of the software that you want to build, regardless of the programming language that you use.\nIn fact, writing Excel/GoogleSheet formulas is similar to programming, the formulas are instructions to Excel with cell ranges as its input, and programming code is machine instructions to the computer. It's ok to invest a bit more time in fundamentals, based on my experience, you need to regularly revisit the fundamentals.\n\n#\nTech to learn\nAny general purpose programming language is fine,  I think Python is the most practical way to get started with programming, with Python alone you can build many things from games, software, web servers, and many more! I started with C++, I would start with Python if I knew the underlying programming fundamentals are mostly the same, the time learning and tinkering with C++ syntaxes and features would have been better to be invested in other fundamentals such as operating systems, computer networking, database.\n\n#\nLearning sources\nAny beginner Python books focusing on the programming basics.\n\n#\nBuilding a website\n\n#\nWhy\nI recommend to learn building a website first instead of building a mobile app because it’s easier to iterate and test. The experience from building a website and some the fundamentals are aplicable to mobile apps as well.\n\n#\nTech to learn\n\nBasic HTML\nBasic CSS, learn what's the role of CSS and how to do basic styling.\nBasic Javascript, same as CSS but instead of styling learn how to manipulate HTML with javascript.\n\n\n#\nLearning sources\n\nAny basic html books.\nA huge plus point if you’re interested in CSS &amp; Javascript. Using video as learning sources can help you to visualize and learn CSS &amp; Javascript since mostly it's UI based.\n\n\n#\nBuilding a webserver\n\n#\nWhy\nMost tech products are connected to the internet nowadays, a website is basically a product that the end users see on the UI side (we call it the client side), the web server is responsible for serving dynamic data to the client (your website).\nYou will try to connect the website that you build from the previous learning point with the webserver and learn how these two interact with each other.\n\n#\nTech to learn\n\n\nPython web framework. It's ok if you have time and want to build without a web framework, it's going to be a lot more challenging but will be more rewarding. I think the easiest way to start is with Python Flask.\n\n\nDatabase. A database is like a warehouse where you can organize and store data, for example user registration data will be stored in a database. I recommend learning MySQL / PostgreSQL first, they are categorized as relational database (RDBMS) in terms of data model.

It misleads people.\nThe more detailed your documentation is, the more likely it'll go outdated, pick a balance.\nIf it's a critical part of the software then be as detailed as possible, you need to balance with risk of outdated documentation.\nSoftware critical parts usually have more than 1 person who knows about it, so you can cover each other to make sure the documentation is up to date.\n\n\n#\nIs It Worth Documenting?\nDocumentation is an investment, you need to choose which one to invest, not everything is worth documenting.\nI have my own personal heuristics on things that are worth to document:\n\nRepetitive manual work that cannot be automated/need manual intervention. It's a lot easier to delegate if you have documentation.\nThings that are less likely to change but often being asked. For example, high level guides of\nservice common components (secret engine, query layer, business logic layer, etc.) that explain how\nthe components interact with each other.\nPost mortem docs, past mistakes and incidents because mostly we can learn something from it\nand something in the past is constant.\nThings that are commonly asked by my collagues.

In this case you take the responsibility. Yes, the team lead is responsible for the project, even though you should held people accountable.\nJust like a CEO is responsible for the overall success of a company, team lead is responsible for the overall success of a team.\nIn most cases your manager will require a report of what failed and what can be improved.

The real deal is when you start managing your dotfiles configuration.\nI put my dotfiles configuration on my github, I just\nneed to clone it and run my setup script to get my ideal work environment 🍻.\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/terminal/living-in-the-terminal/","title":"Living In The Terminal"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/tools/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/tools/","title":""},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/tools/productivity-over-9000/":{"body":"\n  \n\nWhy you should learn and use vim keybindings.\nIt started 2 years ago when I decided to invest in vim.\nThe first weeks with vim were hell, I wasn't productive at all.\nSo I consider it as an investment, and it pays well.\nLet me show you a simple example, let's say I have this code (written in Swift).\nfunc add(x: Int, y: Int) -&gt; Int {\n  return x + y;\n}\n\nand I want to add another function, that is a multiply function\nfunc multiply(x: Int, y: Int) -&gt; Int {\n  return x * y;\n}\n\n\n#\nThe old days\nIn the old days, I would need around 10-12 seconds by doing these:\n\nMove my right hand off the keyboard towards my mouse\nSelect the add function\nPress ⌘ + c\nMove my right hand to the keyboard again, press arrow down then ⌘ + v\nUse my mouse to place the cursor at + operator and replace it with *\nDouble click add function name and replace it with multiply\n\n\n#\nVim's way\nLet's see with the approach that I would've take with vim, this time it takes around 7-8 seconds:\n\nGo to visual mode with v then press % to block all the add function\nctrl + c (yes I have a custom mapping for copy)\nGo to the bottom line of buffer with G\nctrl + v (custom mapping for paste)\nPress kf+s*&lt;ctrl&gt;-{\n\nk move cursor 1 line up.\nf+ find + operator and move the cursor to it\ns* replace + with *\n&lt;ctrl&gt;-{ back to normal mode\n\n\nPress kHwcw then type mutiply\n\nk move cursor 1 line up\nH (custom mapping) move to the first character at the current line\nw move 1 word (to add function name)\ncw and type multiply will replace add with mutiply\n\n\n\nStep 1-6 combined would take 7-8 seconds for me (let's make it 8 seconds).\nThere it is, I just saved 2-4 seconds of my life. I think it's really worth it.\nThe previous example is a simple one, consider these coding-related operations:\n\nJump between lines\nMove code from line x-y to line z\nChange code inside curly braces (in vim you can use ci{, yes that's only 3 strokes)\nEtc..\n\nNote: You can cheat on step 5 and 6 if you use Vim Easymotion.\nI don't know how much time I've saved for myself, but indeed the investment pays really well.\nSome people will tell you that you should use a real IDE and I couldn't agree more with them, I would tell you the same.\nWith vim in your toolbox, you can install a vim keybindings plugin for your IDE, so you'll get\nthe power of IDE and vim keybindings.\n\n  \n\nPersonally I use XVim for XCode,\nIdeavim for Jetbrains.\nSometimes depending on my mood, I use Spacemacs\n(Pre-configured emacs with a lot of useful packages) with vim keybindings for other stuffs.\nFeel free to see/copy my vimrc.\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/tools/productivity-over-9000/","title":"Coding Productivity Over 9000"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/vim/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/vim/","title":""},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/vim/copy-file-path-from-project-root/":{"body":"I often found myself typing file path manually when explaining code implementation and its use cases to my teammates.\nThe task to type file path manually is very daunting and I hate it so much when I mistyped.\nThe file path I mentioned is relative from project root.
