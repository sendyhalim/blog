we just had intense integrations with our business partners.\nWe have a whitelabel product where registered whitelabel partners can use our core engine\nand put their brand as the label.\n\n  \n\nThe development was very intense because there are some parts that need to be customized\nfor each partners and some of the APIs are not even 100% finished yet. We do the development both ways,\npartners also allocated engineering resource on their side to help with the integration.\nDuring this intense moment, we made some mistakes, both engineering related and non engineering.\nThis post is about the lessons/key takeaways from the experience.\nI'll update the post regularly as the learning process continues, stay tuned!\n\n\n#\nUnix timestamp for all datetime API parameters\nAs of now we're using iso datetime format\nfor datetime fields, it's very likely that your API clients are using a different\nprogramming language / library and the tool that they choose is going to behave differently.\nAt the end unixtimestamp is the most general way to pass datetime data.\n\n#\nsnake_case instead of camelCase for API fields\nWe had multiple integration problems when partners had typo. Let's face it,\neveryone has this experience where you mistype the camelCase format,\ne.g. someField -&gt; somefield. Using snake_case should reduce the possibility\nof the problem thus would save your client's time and your time when doing integration.\n\n#\nUse \"sprint\" as the development estimation time unit\nThere will be times where both parties agrees on to develop new features, depending on the urgency,\nif it's a not a critical feature then I'd advise to always use n sprint as the time estimation.\nThe new non-critical feature takes 4 hours to complete? Set the estimation to 1 sprint,\nif it takes &gt; 50% of sprint points then say it takes 2 sprints. Development is not just\nabout code-complete, it's about delivering the features that meet the expectation\nwith minimum bugs and 0 critical bug, probably you need to update your API docs too.\n\n#\nHandling major changes/decisions\nMake sure major changes/decisions will be discussed internally first, there will be different\npoint of views, from product, UI/UX, engineering. Anything related to the major decisions should be answered with Let us discuss internally first, we'll get back to you by X day(s)\n\n#\nRemember, it's a partnership\nThis is a partnership, it's a relationship where we will work together as a partner for\nmutual benefits, it's not a stage to throw mistakes, it's a stage to perform together\nand achieve great things together. Having this mindset will help your emotion and stress level in check.\n","id":"https://sendyhalim.github.io/blog/posts/development-practices/partnership-system-integration-tips/","title":"Partnership System Integration Tips"},"https://sendyhalim.github.io/blog/posts/development-practices/tips-on-technical-design-doc/":{"body":"Having to write a technical design doc(TDD) is a prerequisite of a medium-high feature development/refactoring initiative at Cermati, it's part of the planning process.\nYou need make sure that the team &amp; stakeholders agree on the technical plan/initiative that you want to achieve, this is done through a design doc review process by your CTO/Managers/Stakeholders.\nIt's an essential part of the planning process because it brings people together, especially the team and stakeholders. Get the buy in, distribute the tasks, execute the plan and have cookies 🍪🍪!\nThe post will cover some of the tips that hopefully will help you to write better TDD.\nJust like writing code, the easier it is to understand, the easier it is to review, save time and make your team &amp; stakeholders happy 🍻.\n\n#\n1. Show the current state in the Background section\nAssume your reviewers do not know anything about the current state or just assume they're not up to date.\nFeel free to put links to other existing docs as well. I find it using diagram flow helps a lot to get people catch up with the current state.\nFree tools that you can use:\n\ndiagrams.net\nMermaidJS\n\n\n#\n2. Continue with problem statement\nExplain why you're proposing the initiative. Why does it matter?\nWhat impact will it bring? Maybe answering any of the below question would help you to set the impact:\n\nWill it increase company's North Star metric either directly or indirectly?\nWill it reduce cost of a tool that we use?\nAre you investing for future needs? Why that specific investment matters?\nThe current process that we have might have pain points and you want to improve it to increase employee/team productivity.\n\n\n#\n3. Show the available options/solutions that we have\nResearching the available options that we have and mentioning the pros and cons of each option will clear up a lot of things. This will save up a lot of time and help you get the buy in quicker.\nThe available options also make it easier for us to get back here quickly in case we chose to pursue the wrong option.\n\n#\n4. What are the actionables &amp; timelines\nEach team have different missions, even though the end goals should align company's goals, mentioning all of the actionables/tasks give more\naccurate timeline estimation. Set the PIC as well, it could be a team(in which the team lead will delegate the tasks) or an individual contributor.\nMake sure all the PICs agree on the timeline and put it in the document.\n\n#\n5. What's your backup plan\nThings could fail even with an almost perfect plan, what's your revert/backup plan?\nIf a migration plan fails, what should we do? Is there a way to turn back? If there's a way, should we continue with the risk or is there anything that we should do?\nWhat's the step of the revert/backup plan? Who's going to execute it?\nAnother case with product engineering, if what we plan does not meet the deadline, what are non-essentials features that we can cut? Can we move them into the next iterations?\n\n#\n6. Gather feedback\nThere's no perfect plan, open feedback session and verify their concerns. It's not uncommon for the planner to miss some things due to lack of visibility and deadline to write the plan,\nthe lack of visibility usually comes due to fast moving parts within certain parts of the process, for example you're reading a code that's under development by other team.\nDon't worry too much, that's why you should have the technical design doc review meeting 🖖.

A typical workflow for submitting &amp; merging your feature:\n\nCreate a new feature branch based on master branch, develop and git commit locally from there.\nSubmit code review arc diff when we're done.\nRun arc land to merge our diff to remote master branch.\n\narc land will squash all of the commits into 1 commit on the feature branch, it uses diff title and description as the commit message. We can also simulate arc land manually, maybe not 100% exact though:\n\ngit checkout master to make sure local master branch is up to date.\ngit checkout &lt;feature-branch&gt;\ngit rebase master -i and squash all of the &lt;feature-branch&gt; commits into 1 commit on top of master branch.\nMerge the rebased &amp; squashed feature branch to remote master.\nCheckout to master and pull origin master.\n\nThis typical flow works if we work on separate features at the same time, but it could fail if we try to develop feature on top of other feature that's still in code review (submitted to phabricator). There are many cases this failure could happen, one of the frequent one is when we develop feature-b on top of feature-a where feature-a is still in code review.\n\n#\nSimulation\nWe'll be using this repo as example.\nAssumptions:\nM = master\nFA = feature a\nFB = feature b\n\nmx&lt;n&gt; = commit on master branch\nax&lt;n&gt; = commit on feature-a branch\nbx&lt;n&gt; = commit on feature-b branch\n\nThe condition will look like below:\n\nmaster branch: 3 commits mx1, mx2, and mx3.\nfeature-a branch: 2 commits ax1 and ax2.\nfeature-b branch: 3 commits bx1, bx2 and bx3, it's  built on top of feature-a.\n\nmx1---mx2---mx3---&gt; [M]\n               \\\n                ax1---ax2---&gt; [FA]\n                         \\\n                          bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\n\n#\nArc land feature-a branch\nLet's say that your feature-a is accepted via code review process and you do arc land, it'll squash commits ax1 and ax2 into 1 commit.\n# Process view\n# S = squash\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---&gt; [M]\n               \\         /---bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n                ax1---ax2---&gt; [FA]\n                 |     |\n                 S     S\n# End result\n# There's a new commit \"ax\" that represents commit ax1 and ax2.\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---ax---&gt; [M]\n               \\\n                ax1---ax2---bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\nfeature-b doesn't need ax1 and ax2 because it's already represented by ax. It will fail if you've submitted feature-b for code review and do arc land, the reason is because it could not merge \"cleanly\". The fix is actually pretty easy, you need to point commit bx1 to ax. We will do git rebase to rewrite the history, PLEASE BACKUP feature-b first before you do this, you can do it by checking-out out from feature-b to another branch.\ngit checkout feature-b\n\n# Backup for safety\ngit checkout -b feature-b-backup\n\n\n#\nRewriting history\nFirst, make sure that we're on feature-b and then we will run rebase interactive to drop commits ax1 and ax2.\nIt should be safe because both commits are already in master (represented by ax commit).\n# Do interactive rebase onto master\n# --------------------\ngit rebase -i master\n\nThere will be an editor prompt that should look like\npick 233a9b8 ax1\npick 5f5e3ce ax2\npick e145774 bx1\npick 1834f7d bx2\npick 95d155a bx3\n\nYou have 2 options remove ax1 and ax2:\n\nDelete the lines\nReplace pick with drop\n\nYou can do either one but I'll go with drop to make it more explicit in this post\ndrop 233a9b8 ax1\ndrop 5f5e3ce ax2\npick e145774 bx1\npick 1834f7d bx2\npick 95d155a bx3\n\nSave your changes and quit editor, the rebase process will continue by itself.\nNow your feature-b should point to the latest commit on local master branch, you can verify this via git log or use a GUI tool.\ngit log --oneline --decorate --color --graph\n\n# End result\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---ax---&gt; [M]\n                    \\\n                     bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\nThat's it, now you can do arc land cleanly. I hope it helps, wish there's an easier way.\n\n#\nPost Updates\nMost recent updates:\n\nGot feedback from Daniel Albert regarding the rebase process, we could use git rebase -i master to reduce confusion.

Planning, why planning is important? I think I can use British Army's 7Ps to explain why: Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance.\nThere are several key points that I always keep in my mental notes:\n\nDescribe the background why we're aiming for a specific goal, you can use a top-bottom model to lower barrier of entry in your plan.\nMake sure the PIC understand the details of the plan by planning together, you make the team owns the plan by planning together instead of by yourself.\nWrite the plan in a sharable-docs (we use google docs).\n\nRemember to open the opportunity for team members (brave souls 🤞) to let them lead the planning and guide if needed, everyone\nshould be able to plan ahead, it's a general skill that will be useful in life.\n\n#\nCommunicate the plan &amp; gather feedback\nYour team goals have stakeholders, be it upper management, product team, marketing team, etc2. Communicate the plan to stakeholders &amp; gather feedback,\nyou can do this by setting up a meeting or possibly just via email if the goal is small-medium size (in my case it's usually &lt; 1 week of work).\n\n#\nSplit the work after the plan is approved\nAt this step you need to split the tasks according to the plan and distribute the work across your team members or other team(s).\nYou can use software for subtasking or just use excel should be ok as long as it's clear.\n\n#\nEggggggggggxecute and reporting\nThis is the grinding part, the PIC will execute the plan and team lead is expected to \"guard\" the execution a.k.a make sure it's done properly, be ready to get your hands dirty as well, remember to unblock your team member.\nLet the PIC know explicitly that there might be changes along the road, just remember to revise the plan &amp; report back to stakeholders.\nThere are 3 kind of reports that I usually find myself do:\n\nOfficial reporting regarding the project, it depends on your stakeholders, updating the progress in your plan documentation and send the TLDR version via email should be enough in most cases.\nWeekly reporting to my manager, this report contains the overall projects progress (achievements/other important highlights) running within the team.\n[Optional] Most of the time it's a good idea to setup a specific slack channel (or just use whatever software your company use) for medium-high complexity project and let stakeholders to decide whether they want to join the channel or not,\nthis channel should be useful for organizing chats &amp; discussions scoping.\n\n\n#\nThe fun and the ugly part\nMission completed? Make sure you give credit where credit is due, credit the PIC, team members and other parties that contribute to the project.\nHave celebration then focus on the next goal.\nThe ugly part: mission failed. In this case you take the responsibility. Yes, the team lead is responsible for the project, even though you should held people accountable.\nJust like a CEO is responsible for the overall success of a company, team lead is responsible for the overall success of a team.\nIn most cases your manager will require a report of what failed and what can be improved. Take it as a learning to get better!
