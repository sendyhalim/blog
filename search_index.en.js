We do the development both ways,\npartners also allocated engineering resource on their side to help with the integration.\nDuring this intense moment, we made some mistakes, both engineering related and non engineering.\nThis post is about the lessons/key takeaways from the experience.\nI'll update the post regularly as the learning process continues, stay tuned!\n\n\n#\nUnix timestamp for all datetime API parameters\nAs of now we're using iso datetime format\nfor datetime fields, it's very likely that your API clients are using a different\nprogramming language / library and the tool that they choose is going to behave differently.\nAt the end unixtimestamp is the most general way to pass datetime data.\n\n#\nsnake_case instead of camelCase for API fields\nWe had multiple integration problems when partners had typo. Let's face it,\neveryone has this experience where you mistype the camelCase format,\ne.g. someField -&gt; somefield. Using snake_case should reduce the possibility\nof the problem thus would save your client's time and your time when doing integration.\n\n#\nUse \"sprint\" as the development estimation time unit\nThere will be times where both parties agrees on to develop new features, depending on the urgency,\nif it's a not a critical feature then I'd advise to always use n sprint as the time estimation.\nThe new non-critical feature takes 4 hours to complete? Set the estimation to 1 sprint,\nif it takes &gt; 50% of sprint points then say it takes 2 sprints. Development is not just\nabout code-complete, it's about delivering the features that meet the expectation\nwith minimum bugs and 0 critical bug, probably you need to update your API docs too.\n\n#\nHandling major changes/decisions\nMake sure major changes/decisions will be discussed internally first, there will be different\npoint of views, from product, UI/UX, engineering. Anything related to the major decisions should be answered with Let us discuss internally first, we'll get back to you by X day(s)\n\n#\nRemember, it's a partnership\nThis is a partnership, it's a relationship where we will work together as a partner for\nmutual benefits, it's not a stage to throw mistakes, it's a stage to perform together\nand achieve great things together.

Pick whatever you think is suitable for your project &amp; team, take it with a grain of salt.\nHaving these principles in mind has helped my team to:\n\nMake programming decisions: how to structure code, how to handle errors.\nDecide when should we opt-in for a hack and what's the minimum proper way to apply a \"quickfix\".\nDecide when to invest more in documentations.\n\n\n#\nReadability\nReadability means it's easy to understand, not just easy to read. Easy to understand meaning might vary\nbecause each company/team has different engineering skills standard due to different skillset requirements as well. Having a readability standard set earlier will boost\nteam productivity in the longer run, it'll cut communication cost, reduce the time needed to understand the code, hence improve the team onboarding process.\n\n#\n[Readability] Statically typed language\nIt might be worth the investment to use statically typed language. Code is meant to be read more than it is written,\nstatic typing will improve readability. The compiler will help you eliminate most of the compile-time type errors, which will simplify code reviews, unit testing.\nyou don't need to test data type unless your project requires you to do a lot of runtime type checking, too many runtime checking could be be sign of another problem though (depending on project goals).\n\n#\n[Readability] Invest in code comments\nCode comments can be used to explain \"why\" certain logic is set that way, this will cut communication cost and make debugging a lot easier.\nThe goal is to help your peers and \"future you\" to understand the code either in code review or when we want to revisit the code in the future. Cases where code comment is beneficial:\n\nComplex logic.\nMotivation regarding unorthodox approach.\nHack/quick fix, this would reduce confusion a lot and make it explicit that the approach that's considered a \"hack\" is intended.\n\n\n#\n[Readability] Standard on variable names\nSet an acceptable standard of explicitness with your team.\nOne of the most obvious example is to agree on how to name variables.\n\nUse plural for list, vector or array type.\n\n\n\nUse {value}_by_{type} naming pattern for key-value data structure (hashmap, btreemap, dictionary, etc)\n\n\n\n#\n[Readability] Limit on maximum number of characters per line.\nImagine you're reading a book, you need to scroll both vertically &amp; horizontally\nto read a paragraph because there's no maximum number of characters per line,\nwould it be a good user experience? The same goes for writing code, imagine a line of code\nthat you need to scroll both directions a lot, wouldn't it be easier to just scroll vertically?\n\n#\nModularity\nModular means it's easy to plug &amp; change something because there's a balanced abstraction. Note that in practice, you do not have to abstract everything,\ntoo much abstraction would be make it less readable and harder to understand. It\nwould make the most sense to put abstraction on top of something that would likely to change or\nsomething that already has/will have multiple implementations.\nOne easy example: suppose we want to send\nSMS(maybe for MFA use cases - OTP) to our users, putting an interface on top of the actual vendor\nimplementation might be a good idea, why? Let's start with the business use case, MFA is a critical security feature, having a good OTP delivery rate is crucial for the user experience, we\ncan't rely only to 1 vendor, it's important to have at least another SMS vendor backup in case the the primary vendor is down or there are other problems (latency drops or the delivery rate drops).\nIf we put an interface for it, it's easy to switch. The switch strategy might vary, it could be via a circuit breaker mechanism or just a simple remote config to decide which SMS vendor to use.\nA bit intermezzo, use TOTP might be more secure than OTP.\nThere's a signal that you could use to measure modularity, if it's relatively easy\nto write unit tests then most probably your code is modular enough because it's easy\nto inject dependencies (mock objects in unit test context) and hence will make it easier to refactor things if needed.\n\n#\nError Handling\nSoftware breaks all the time, preferably you want to be able to spot errors before your users do.\nWhen you got error reports you also want to be able to debug it.\n\n#\n[Error Handling] Observability\nMake sure errors do not go into limbo, you want to be able to plot and gauge error rates over time.\nIt should be easy to spot as well.\n\nHow easy is it to be alerted when there are errors?\nCan you see the error logs? How easy is it to see it?\nDo we have a clear separation on what's considered an error? Do not log informational messages as error\n\n\n#\n[Error Handling] Debuggability\nThe easier it is to debug the error, the faster it is to resolve the problem, your time should be spent\nmostly on building products/software instead of debugging.\nSome of the key points to measure your debuggability:\n\nHow easy is it to prioritize errors?

If it can save cost, any estimation by what %?\nAre you investing for future needs? Why does that specific investment matter?\n\n\n#\nRequirements\nThe requirements section set boundaries on the solution, it helps you to filter solutions that can be applied.\nTypically there will be specific functionalities/features that the solutions must provide.\n\n#\nShow the available options/solutions that we have\nThere would be more than one solution that we can apply to meet the requirements, it's preferable to lay out the available options that we have.\nStart with the least preferable solution and list down its pros and cons, progressive move to the most preferable solution.\nMake it clear why we're implementing that specific solution, and why the others won't work as well as the one that you propose.\nShowing the available solutions will make it easier for us to get back here quickly just in case we pursued the wrong solution.\n\n#\nWhat are the success metrics\nDecide on the success metrics that can be monitored.\nFor example, if you're implementing a UX improvement, the success metric should be something related to the feature funnel, one thing that you could do is add trackers to the feature funnel and then query the data through an analytical database,\nor just reuse existing funnel dashboard (if any).\n\n#\nWhat are the action items &amp; timelines\nList all of the action items and set the PIC. PIC could be a team (the team lead will delegate the tasks) or an individual contributor.\nIf the project has milestones then set the deadline for each milestone, if it's not then it's ok to just put the end goal deadline,\nmake sure all the PICs agree with the timeline.\n\n#\nWhat's your backup plan\nThings could fail even with an almost perfect plan, what's your backup plan?\nIf a migration plan fails, what should we do? Is there a way to turn back? If there's a way, should we continue with the risk or is there anything that we should do?\nWhat are the steps of the backup plan? Who's going to execute it?\nSpecifically in product engineering, suppose it does not meet the deadline, then what are non-essential features that we can cut? Can we move them into the next iterations?\n\n#\nGather feedback\nThere's no perfect plan, open a feedback session and verify reviewers concerns. Sometimes there are blind spots due to the lack of visibility/outdated product knowledge,\nfor example the flow that you read has changed after you prepared the plan.\nDon't worry too much, that's why we're doing the technical design doc review session 🖖.\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/development-practices/technical-design-doc-guidelines/","title":"Technical Design Doc Guidelines"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/git/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/git/","title":""},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/git/phabricator-developing-feature-on-top-of-other-feature/":{"body":"NOTES: This post assumes that you're familiar with git rebase and phabricator terms.\nWe use phabricator as our code review tool. A typical workflow for submitting &amp; merging your feature:\n\nCreate a new feature branch based on master branch, develop and git commit locally from there.\nSubmit code review arc diff when we're done.\nRun arc land to merge our diff to remote master branch.\n\narc land will squash all of the commits into 1 commit on the feature branch, it uses diff title and description as the commit message. We can also simulate arc land manually, maybe not 100% exact though:\n\ngit checkout master to make sure local master branch is up to date.\ngit checkout &lt;feature-branch&gt;\ngit rebase master -i and squash all of the &lt;feature-branch&gt; commits into 1 commit on top of master branch.\nMerge the rebased &amp; squashed feature branch to remote master.\nCheckout to master and pull origin master.\n\nThis typical flow works if we work on separate features at the same time, but it could fail if we try to develop feature on top of other feature that's still in code review (submitted to phabricator). There are many cases this failure could happen, one of the frequent one is when we develop feature-b on top of feature-a where feature-a is still in code review.\n\n#\nSimulation\nWe'll be using this repo as example.\nAssumptions:\n\nThe condition will look like below:\n\nmaster branch: 3 commits mx1, mx2, and mx3.\nfeature-a branch: 2 commits ax1 and ax2.\nfeature-b branch: 3 commits bx1, bx2 and bx3, it's  built on top of feature-a.\n\n\n\n#\nArc land feature-a branch\nLet's say that your feature-a is accepted via code review process and you do arc land, it'll squash commits ax1 and ax2 into 1 commit.\n\nfeature-b doesn't need ax1 and ax2 because it's already represented by ax. It will fail if you've submitted feature-b for code review and do arc land, the reason is because it could not merge \"cleanly\". The fix is actually pretty easy, you need to point commit bx1 to ax. We will do git rebase to rewrite the history, PLEASE BACKUP feature-b first before you do this, you can do it by checking-out out from feature-b to another branch.\n\n\n#\nRewriting history\nFirst, make sure that we're on feature-b and then we will run rebase interactive to drop commits ax1 and ax2.\nIt should be safe because both commits are already in master (represented by ax commit).\n\nThere will be an editor prompt that should look like\n\nYou have 2 options remove ax1 and ax2:\n\nDelete the lines\nReplace pick with drop\n\nYou can do either one but I'll go with drop to make it more explicit in this post\n\nSave your changes and quit editor, the rebase process will continue by itself.\nNow your feature-b should point to the latest commit on local master branch, you can verify this via git log or use a GUI tool.\n\nThat's it, now you can do arc land cleanly. I hope it helps, wish there's an easier way.\n\n#\nPost Updates\nMost recent updates:\n\nGot feedback from Daniel Albert regarding the rebase process, we could use git rebase -i master to reduce confusion.

Lastly my car loan last installment was in March 2025, it's paid off when I'm writing this.\nDecision was not easy but was made relatively quick, only by numbers I would make more money if I invested the money in the stock market or put it in other investment.\nActually I was quite comfortable with the debts, but after thinking for a while I came to conlusion that being debt free is going to be worth it, here's why:\n\nI'm able to put more focus only on building wealth. I have more room to take risks, be more bold on good opportunities. Definitely have more courage to average down on good stocks when the market is down.\nGenerally I feel happier without debt, I can't measure it but it feels really good! I sleep better as well.\n\n\n#\nTechnically paying off mortgage?\nMy mortgage started in Apr 2018, the mortgage had a fixed rate of 6.5% for 5 years then floating afterwards, in my case it was 13.5%. Yes banks in Indonesia take very high net interest margin.\nI think it's worth to share that conceptually, mortgage installment amount consists of 2 parts:\n\nPrincipal amount: this is the amount that will reduce the remaining mortgage amount.\nInterest amount: this goes into the bank pocket.\n\nFor every installment payment, it will deduct the principal amount and some of it goes to the interest.\nMost banks use annuity calculation for mortgage where the interest amount is higher at the beginning of the mortgage period and the principal amount is higher at the end of the period.\nIn other words your early installment payments will just mostly pay the interest, mostly goes into the bank pocket 💰.\nBack to the mortgage deal, 6.5% was quite high compared to other banks, but it had a benefit that the saving account interest rate will match the mortgage rate as well. This is a big deal if you're planning to put more money in the saving account.\nI got 6.5% interest rate on saving account for the first 5 years, the 6th year it was floating around 13.5% because mortgage interest rate was also 13.5%.\nThe interest on the saving account is not paid directly into the account balance, rather it deducts the interest from the mortgage installment amount.\nTechnically the mortgage interest would be 0 if you put enough money in the saving account and all the installment payment will deduct principal, in other words 100% of installment payment will deduct the remaining mortgage amount.\nWhat I did to pay off the mortgage was quite simple, I looked up the outstanding mortgage amount then divide the amount by net % after tax on interest, that's the amount I need to put in the saving account so that the installment payment would be deduct 100% only to the principal, 0 interest.\nJust for example, suppose tax on interest is 20% and my outstanding mortgage is 1000, I would need to put 1000 / (1 - 0.2) = 1250 in the saving account.\nIt will be more than enough to cover the remaining installment.\nThe reason I like this approach compared to fully settle all at once is because in loan contract there's a 3% penalty for early loan settlement, in addition to that if there's a super urgent needs for cash I can just withdraw the money from the saving account, though I forbid myself to do that.\n\n#\nMoving forward\nHaving an option to leverage is good, but I think it's better to avoid debt if you can.\nDebt can give a false sense of security, it can easily confuse you to think that you have the capability to buy things.\nSince the mortgage paid off, I always try to avoid debt. Even if there's a 0% installment plan on some of my big purchases, I always choose to pay in full. On the other side paying in full have its own benefits especially for collecting miles, some banks have a policy that you won't get the miles if you choose to pay in installment.\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/life/debt-free-is-it-worth-it/","title":"Debt Free, Is It Worth It?"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/life/melaporkan-kpr-di-spt-pajak-tahunan-orang-pribadi/":{"body":"Post ini akan ditulis dalam bahasa Indonesia karena memang target audiencenya adalah orang Indonesia.\nPerlu dicatat bahwa jangan mengikuti langkah-langkah yang saya lakukan tanpa berkonsultasi dengan ahli pajak Anda!

After some iterations, there's a noticeable common pattern in problem-solving and execution.\nUsing just instinct is actually ok, but having a structure would make it easier to document, distribute/share and extend the approach.\nProblem-solving structure is also useful in high-pressure situations to greatly reduce the chance of missing a step or two.\nNowadays, my default would be to try to structure everything, this applies in life not just in a work environment.\nI'm sharing what I currently have in mind regarding this, I hope this post can help you to structure executions and be more effective.\n\n#\nStructure in Problem Solving\n\n#\nInitial thoughts\nWe can set a structure for problem-solving approach, though it might differ for everyone because everyone has different problems with different patterns.\nJust for example, a simple problem-solving structure could look something like this:\n\nProblem background, we need to understand the context and the problem first, and make sure it actually exists, this can be done by reading user feedback, looking at the data, etc.\nProblem priority, the problem may exist but it's better if we evaluate whether it's worth it solving or not. After all, we already have many problems to solve right? If it's worth it then evaluate and set the problem priority.\nTypically we want to solve the higher priority problems first, starting with the easiest ones if there are problems with the same priorities.\nProblem delegation, suppose we decide to solve it, do we have the capacity? Can it be delegated?\nPlan for solution, is the problem quite common? Do we have existing solutions that we could use or should we formulate our own solution?\nExecution, just get it done.\nMonitoring, how do I know the problem is solved? Can we monitor the data?\n\n\n#\nDecompose the problem\nUnless it's straightforward, a problem typically can be decomposed into simpler subproblems. Those subproblems\nprobably can be broken down again, the depth depends on how big the problem is and how would you balance it.\nDecomposing a problem makes it easier to delegate and find a specific solution to the subproblems.\nTry to find the balance, if it's too small then probably we'll end up spending unnecessary time breaking it down instead of\nactually solving the problem, if it's too big then the execution might be suboptimal due to overwhelming assignment.\nWhat I find is, generally it's easier to break down problems based on the skillset required to solve them because it'll be easier to\ndelegate to a team/people of a specific role.\n\n#\nAttempts to apply structure on other cases\nWe're going to go through some examples outside of general problem-solving structure,\nwe will try to apply structure to each case. I encourage you to try to make your own examples at the end.\n\n#\nExample: Launching a new product\nSuppose we have evaluated that it's worth it to launch a new software product (a problem worth solving), the assignment structure could be divided into:\n\nProduct management -&gt; assign to the Product team\nUI &amp; flow component -&gt; assign to UI/UX team\nDevelopment component -&gt; assign to the Engineering team\nMarketing component -&gt; assign to the Marketing team\n\nEach of the team could break down the assignment into multiple subproblems until we\nthink it's quite optimal, the development team could divide development effort into:\n\nBackend Team\nAndroid Team\niOS Team\nEngineering Infra Team, maybe we need to spin more servers.\n\nFollowing up on the assignment structure, each team could have its own execution structure, it doesn't have to follow the same structure\nbecause the way to solve the subproblem could differ. Engineering teams typically use agile methodology meanwhile marketing might use other approaches.\n\n#\nExample: Covering to lead a meeting\nThere's a product-themed meeting coming soon, but the lead product manager that's supposed to lead the meeting was on sick leave on that day.\nI was asked to help lead the meeting since the other person that knows the high-level details was only me,\nI was kind of nervous because I'm more accustomed to leading engineering-themed meetings.\nPlease note I'm not talking about meeting structure, we already have it and we can just follow the usual meeting structure,\nbut my goal was to up my understanding and confidence level leading a product-themed meeting.\nLet's try to structure it:\n\nI think it's best to write down the meeting objectives first with our own sentences.\nThen break down what would be the key points/outline needed to be discussed to meet the objectives.\nTry to visualize how would the meeting run with the above key points.\n\n\n#\nExample: Going for a vacation\nI would like to have a vacation in Japan with my family, the top level structure to get to the goal would be:\n\nVacation dates\nItinerary\nBudget planning\n\nSame with other problems, we can break each point into subproblems/checklists, vacation dates could be broken down into:\n\nFind out the date ranges with low workload so we can have vacations stress free\nGet buy-in from family\nGet annual leave approval\n\nThe itinerary is probably the easiest to delegate, if I don't have time I'll just reuse itineraries made by other people.\n\n#\nKey takeaways\n\nNot every problem is worth solving, try to prioritize.\nWhen there’s a problem try to think about the problem structure first then break it down into subproblems until it's quite optimal, follow the structure and move towards the solution.\nIf it's too much for you, always consider delegating the subproblems, especially the ones that can be run in parallel.\nStructure can be applied in many cases.\n\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/life/setting-up-a-structure-on-problem-solving-and-life/","title":"Everything has a structure, thoughts on problem solving structure"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/life/the-2nd-macbook-purchase/":{"body":"\n#\nMy first MacBook\nI was at the office lift waiting to reach level 12, my wife sent me a chat that my MacBook suddenly could not be charged, she was using it for some boring administration stuffs.\nBy just looking at the MagSafe charging pin you can tell it's most likely because of the MagSafe, not the MacBook.\nIt's my first Macbook that I had in March 2015, a 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro model that was launched in 2014.\nBought it at iBox Central Park Mall Jakarta. I've been using it quite extensively for learning and programming for almost 10 years, what a memory.\nNothing beats MacBook in terms of trackpad and programming experience, smooth typing experience and most things just works in macOS.\nMost of the time it's plugged into a charger paired with a cheap $200 Dell external monitor through HDMI cable.\nThe MacBook almost had no issues and the system almost never freezes, the only recurring issue was related with MagSafe.\nThe original MagSafe was broken because I accidentally pulled the thin cable in 2020 which I replaced with a cheap $20 MagSafe knockoff.\nThe MacBook only got the macOS update up until Big Sur before Apple dropped OS support for 2014 MacBook, so 2020 is the final year that it gets the latest macOS.\nI didn't mind having an outdated macOS as long as it's still functioning well,  my frugal lifestyle would've never thought to buy a new one up until it's broken.\nAround 2022, my MacBook battery started to swole a bit, typical indication of aging battery. And when the time it stopped charging on Feb 2025, I've been using it for almost 10 years so I like the option to buy a new one or I can just buy a new MagSafe.\n\n#\nBuying a new one\nApple just launched a new MacBook pro with M4 processor and 16GB RAM as the base model, it's the first time they made it a standard.🍻\nThe price point for 14 inch base model one is similar to my MacBook, quite a good deal. I inquired official Apple resellers Digimap and iBox for the space black color but it's out of stock.\nOther option is to buy another knockoff MagSafe to cover some of the work that needed to be completed at the end of the month, I'm willing to wait for a day or two maybe it will be back in stock. 2 days later it's still out of stock, I convinced myself to buy a new MagSafe at weekend.\n\n#\nAligned Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️\nOn Thursday 16 February 2025, I went to work normally in the morning, the office is at Plaza Bank Index.\nThere was a road closure near the office, I could not get directly into the office building. I decided to park in Plaza Indonesia (PI) which right across the office building,\nwent through the PI gate at 09:30 but unfortunately the parking gate into the mall was closed. So I went straight to Grand Indonesia (GI) and was able to park there at level 7.\nI took lift down to the ground level thinking that later I can exit the mall quicker then walk and cross the street straight to the office. The lift opened and as I was approaching the exit door suddenly I needed to go to the toilet, there's no toilet nearby so I took the lift up to level 1. Most of the tenants staffs were still preparing to open the store. I saw a janitor getting ready to start the mopping machine, I asked him where's the nearest toilet and he pointed to the toilet inside the Central Department Store. After toilet, I went out of the department store and somehow I chose the lane that led to Digimap (Apple Official Reseller).\nI got a gut feeling that I should ask about the MacBook availability, putting risk to be late to the office.\nApparently they have one MacBook Pro M4 Space Black base model in stock, I was running late so I requested to reserve the MacBook for me until\nlunch time. Looking at previous events, the stars are aligned, I have zero doubt to buy a new one. I wrote this post with my new MacBook, hoping it would last for another long years 🍻 up until\nApple dropped macOS supports for the machine.\n\n#\nSome lessons learned from the first MacBook\nThese are the things that I learned that supposedly improved MacBook lifespan:\n\nNo hardcase: Dust quickly accumulated in the hardcase, the case also blocks some of the heat released from the aluminum case.\nNo screen protector: MacBook is not a touch screen, also adding a screen protector will risk screen to crack because there's additional pressure when closing the lid.\nNo keyboard protector: Keyboard protector blocks the air flow from the keyboard.\nBuy a new macbook when Apple stops supporting macOS updates: Every new macOS release only supports a certain machine type and some of the updates will include security patches, it's in my best interest to be always up to date with the most recent security patches.\n\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/life/the-2nd-macbook-purchase/","title":"The 2nd MacBook Purchase"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/programming/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/programming/","title":""},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/programming/traceroute-naive-implementation-part-1-proof-of-concept/":{"body":"\n#\nWhat we will do\nTraceroute is a utility that will print packet router path (trace) and measure the delay of packets sent to a destination.\nIt works by sending packet probes to a destination with increasing (by 1) IP TTL/IP hop limit starting from 1,\nTTL will be reduced by 1 every time the packet reaches a router. The router will discard the packet and send back an ICMP Time Exceeded error when it receives IP packet with TTL 1 because it's going to be 0 (expired).\nIn this post, we'll try to experiment with IP TTL as a basic component of traceroute implementation. We start with a proof of concept (PoC) implementation.\nThe goal is to learn by doing so expect bad error handling and bad UX.\n\n#\nKey components in the PoC\nKey components in our proof of concept:\n\nWe will create a socket that listens to ICMP messages. As a starter,\nwe will try to capture all ICMP packets sent to our IP and print it.\nWe'll just try to see manually whether there's any ICMP Time Exceeded error sent from\none of the routers in the path. We can try to run the traceroute command to the same destination (google.com) before running\nthe program so we can compare the router IP at a specific hop.\nWe will send the packet probe when the ICMP listener is ready,\nwe'll just send 1 probe to the 6th router along the path to reach google.com since we're focusing\nonly for a proof of concept, this way we know what's the router IP at the 6th hop.\nThe program will only handle IPv4.\nWe will not do proper error handling, we'll just print debug messages for simplicity.\n\nWe will revisit and iterate the limitations in future posts.\n\n#\nDebugging\nWe use tcpdump to print out the UDP packet that we send to the destination IP,\nwe should be able to see the IP TTL that we set through tcpdump. You could use\nother network packet sniffing tools such as Wireshark though.\n\n#\nImplementation\n\n    \n\n\n#\nSetup\n\n#\nDependencies\nI'm using rust in the example because it provides extensive low-level tooling and\nI just want to have a refresher on rust, you can write the implementation using any programming language that you're comfortable with\nas long as it has access to low-level socket programming.\nWe will install these dependencies:\n\nsocket2 - Utility to work with low-level networking socket.\netherparse - Library that provides low level network packet parsing logic (IPv4, UDP, ICMP, etc).\n\n\n\n#\nDirectory structure\nOur directory structure will look like this\n\n\n#\nICMP listener\n\n#\nCreate an ICMP socket\nThere will be  a function to start an ICMP listener,\nit's basically creating a socket that we can use to capture the incoming messages later on.\n\n\n#\nCapturing ICMP packets\nWe need to prepare the ICMP response placeholder first, the ICMP response will include IPv4 so we will need\n28 bytes considering the minimum IPv4 header is 20 bytes and all ICMP packets have an 8-byte header.\nThen we initiate an infinite loop and short polling to the ICMP socket by calling icmp_socket.recv_from(..),\nthe method will block until there's a response or it's reaching 1 second -- the read timeout that we set earlier.\nOn every incoming packet, we use etherparse to parse bytes into an IPv4 header and assume the rest of the unused bytes to be ICMP payload.\n\n\n#\nSend a UDP probe\nNext, we go to the main function. Let's just assume we want to know the router at 6th hop going to google.com,\nwe use ToSocketAddrs trait that gives us the extra capability to convert the domain name to IP address (it will do DNS lookup in the background).\n\n\n#\nTesting it out\nWe'll start a tcpdump to sniff the IP packet that we send, we should expect\nthe right IP address and IP TTL to be 6 (hardcoded earlier).\n\nNow build and run the program\n\nFrom the tcpdump you should see something like this\n\nThe sample program output\n\nWe can compare it by running traceroute and checking whether the router at the 6th hop has the same router IP that we have captured (output above).

Pretty much similar to\nbreaking a big task into smaller tasks so it's easier to complete because we focus on smaller changes, it's also easier to review a small PR.\nThere are many ways to organize the PR into small and meaningful changes, some of the common ones that I've seen:\n\nA PR is considered small enough at max around 100 lines of code. This is completely up to team standard, set a number that the team can accept that it's small enough.\nConsider splitting a PR containing more than 100 lines of code into multiple PRs, the split could be based on:\n\nFunctionality. For example, the PR contains 2 new HTTP APIs to create a new user and get user details, we can split the flow to create a new user and get user details into separate 2 PRs.\nImplementation Layer. For example, the PR contains 1 new HTTP API layer with long validation logic and a new business logic layer, we can split it into a separate PR for the new business logic layer with unit tests and another PR that contains the new API and validation logic.\n\n\n\nRule of thumb: the more code that needs to be reviewed, the less the code review quality.\nPeople tend to miss some important details (including me!) when reviewing a long PR.\n\n#\nReview your own changes\nReviewing your own PR/changes before requesting for review brings a lot of benefits:\n\nYou can spot mistakes earlier and it saves a lot of time for the team, supposedly we can review our own changes quickly because we have the most context of how the code works. Suppose it takes 10 minutes for each engineer to review a PR, the author probably would take only ~4 minutes to review the PR, if self-reviewing the PR could reduce peer review time to 6 minutes then in total it would only take 16 minutes of review time. Imagine if it's summed up for all code reviews in a year! All of those numbers are assumed, I'm sure you get the idea, you can plug whatever the average review time that's spent in your company.\n\n\n  \n    Typical code review time illustration\n    \n  \n  \n    Code review time illustration with self review\n    \n  \n\n\nEngineers would be more motivated (been there) to review a PR from someone who has the reputation to always re-check PR before submission because it's more likely to be in a better review state. You get your PR reviewed quicker in turn which also means you get to ship your feature faster. Having a self-code review checklist could also help to spot your own mistakes earlier, you can follow this common checklist:\n\nMake sure the PR fulfills task requirements.\nSpot any potential security issues e.g. is there any resource that shouldn't be accessed publicly? are you using deprecated crypto algo?\nMake sure the PR follows the team code convention and is ideally free of linter warnings.\nMake sure complex code is documented properly.\nMake sure hackish code is documented properly, explain why it's necessary.\n\n\n\n\n#\nWrite and update unit tests\nAlways write or update unit tests for any additions or changes at the business logic level.\nUnit tests are intended to catch bugs earlier and they also help reviewers to understand and simulate how the PR code works. Read more about unit tests best practices here\n\n#\nWrite a quick/simple tutorial how to test your changes\nIf you can write tutorials on how to test your changes means you're testing your changes. Tutorials can be as simple as follows.\n\nPR containing HTTP API changes, you can provide curl examples for some of the most common cases.\nFor PR containing script/worker, you can provide examples of how to run it and what's the expected high-level side effects.\n\nPersonally, manual testing helps me psychologically (read: will help you to sleep better at night) by knowing that it works and it improves confidence as well.

I personally think there's too much noise on the learning path nowadays.\nA little bit of my background, I'm a self taught, I do software engineering for fun and I was lucky to land an engineering role at Cermati in 2015, so I’m confident that I can say a thing or two regarding getting into the software engineering field. I will write another post on the details of the journey, this post will focus on my version of balanced practical approach to get into the software engineering field.\nI hope this post can be useful as a guideline and inspiration for other people to get into the software engineering role.\n\n#\nLearning Keypoints\nIt's very common for everyone to have varying learning journeys, I think there are some important points to keep in mind regardless of your learning path:\n\nIt's a lot easier to pick a specific learning path if you know what you want. It ranges from wanting to build a tech startup, switching career to tech or just finding a new hobby.\nIf you just want to try things out whether software engineering fits you or not, then I would recommend finding a problem that you think can be solved with software. Typically, repetitive tedious tasks can be solved or automated by software, keep the problem in your mental notes so it's easier to relate to it during learning. Try to think whether it’s possible to solve your problem with your current tech skills, if not then try to find the missing learning components.\nFocus on the fundamentals. There are many engineering tools and frameworks, it's a common pattern to come across a \"new cool thing\" in software engineering. The tools you learn today could be obsolete anytime in the future, the fundamentals however typically can be applied to most of the tools. Be curious, always ask why? Why things work that way, why things are built that way.\nIt’s expected to not understand subjects from the learning source you're currently on, don’t give up yet! My tip is to search other learning sources on the same topic and try to learn from different perspectives, you can do it by googling or youtube or just asking ChatGPT, beware though it might not be 100% on point, you need to reverify the answer by re-reading the subject from other sources.\nI’m recommending to read books as your main learning source, it’s structured and easy to search by text. At the very minimum, books with 100+ reviews and 4.5+ stars on Amazon.com should be ok. Watching videos are ok but I think it’s hard to search for a specific explanation by keyword. You could also do bootcamps, but it seems most of them put more emphasis on the frameworks/tools instead of the fundamentals though.\nSoftware engineering is a craft, the more you put in the hours to write software the more you’ll get better.\n\n\n#\nLearning Path\nFollowing a balanced practical path throughout your journey is crucial, you want to know the fundamentals and be able to practically apply them. The fundamentals will set you apart and help you make better engineering decisions, for example, which tools (language, framework, libraries) to use and how to use them properly.\nThe learning path that I'm recommending might take ~12 months with dedication, around 1-2 hours per day on average, it consists of mainly 3 components:\n\nProgramming fundamentals, focusing on the basic programming concept as the foundation for you to build software.\nBuilding a website, I think it's a good idea to start with building a basic website UI, we will build the server side later on since most of tech products are connected to the internet.\nBuilding a web server, a web server is responsible to process, store, and serve user website data. Imagine a user registration functionality where users can input email and password, the data will be processed and stored on the web server side.\n\n\n#\nProgramming Fundamentals\n\n#\nWhy\nProgramming fundamentals can be applied to most of the software that you want to build, regardless of the programming language that you use.\nIn fact, writing Excel/GoogleSheet formulas is similar to programming, the formulas are instructions to Excel with cell ranges as its input, and programming code is machine instructions to the computer. It's ok to invest a bit more time in fundamentals, based on my experience, you need to regularly revisit the fundamentals.\n\n#\nTech to learn\nAny general purpose programming language is fine,  I think Python is the most practical way to get started with programming, with Python alone you can build many things from games, software, web servers, and many more! I started with C++, I would start with Python if I knew the underlying programming fundamentals are mostly the same, the time learning and tinkering with C++ syntaxes and features would have been better to be invested in other fundamentals such as operating systems, computer networking, database.\n\n#\nLearning sources\nAny beginner Python books focusing on the programming basics.\n\n#\nBuilding a website\n\n#\nWhy\nI recommend to learn building a website first instead of building a mobile app because it’s easier to iterate and test. The experience from building a website and some the fundamentals are aplicable to mobile apps as well.\n\n#\nTech to learn\n\nBasic HTML\nBasic CSS, learn what's the role of CSS and how to do basic styling.\nBasic Javascript, same as CSS but instead of styling learn how to manipulate HTML with javascript.\n\n\n#\nLearning sources\n\nAny basic html books.\nA huge plus point if you’re interested in CSS &amp; Javascript. Using video as learning sources can help you to visualize and learn CSS &amp; Javascript since mostly it's UI based.\n\n\n#\nBuilding a webserver\n\n#\nWhy\nMost tech products are connected to the internet nowadays, a website is basically a product that the end users see on the UI side (we call it the client side), the web server is responsible for serving dynamic data to the client (your website).\nYou will try to connect the website that you build from the previous learning point with the webserver and learn how these two interact with each other.\n\n#\nTech to learn\n\n\nPython web framework. It's ok if you have time and want to build without a web framework, it's going to be a lot more challenging but will be more rewarding. I think the easiest way to start is with Python Flask.\n\n\nDatabase. A database is like a warehouse where you can organize and store data, for example user registration data will be stored in a database. I recommend learning MySQL / PostgreSQL first, they are categorized as relational database (RDBMS) in terms of data model. It's longer to get started compared with MongoDB, but I think it's better to start with RDBMS since it's more common.\n\n\n\n#\nLearning sources\nAny Python book related to building a web app with a web framework should have a database introduction included.\n\n#\nWhat’s next?\nDo not aim to be perfect, just start and get things done first, you can iterate later on while you’re learning. The more you put in the hours to write software the more you’ll get better.\nYou will still need to visit other fundamentals, I'm still building my fundamentals up until now and there's always more to learn and discover, it's actually fun!

It is easy to detect because the unit tests would be red (not passing), typically it'll look like failing unit tests, you can just fix it rightaway and rerun the test cases.\nDuring end to end testing. Logic errors in unit tests are typically similar to a situation where you do not write unit tests thus if there's a bug in one of the function\nit would be detected at end to end testing, it is more costly to retest end-to-end compared to reruning unit test.\n\n\n#\nHow to prevent it\nThere's no solution that will prevent logic errors by 100%, but I can recommend 2 things to incorporate in your unit testing workflow so you can minimize it:\n\n\nSimilar when doing a feature development task, in the task you need to understand the requirements first and start thinking from user's perspective and how\nwould the feature will be used. In unit tests you're testing a function (smaller unit) that's part of the feature, so you could list down the function requirements (what\ndo you expect from the function), write down the positive cases, negative cases, and possible edge cases, then review and write the unit tests based on the cases.\nThis mindset will help you write better unit tests and complete your function implementation faster.\n\n\nI highly recommend to deliberately make your newly written unit tests fail first, this will ensure that your unit tests are asserting properly. I had experience where\nthe unit tests are green but it's not running assertion properly, I was lucky that I found out about it after testing the end to end feature manually.\nI did like 3-4 times of end to end testing, probably I would only need to do 1-2 end to end testing if the unit tests assertions were not buggy.\n\n\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/software-engineering/unit-testing/minimizing-logic-errors-in-unit-tests/","title":"Unit Testing: Minimizing Logic Errors In Unit Tests"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/software-engineering/unit-testing/organizing-unit-tests/":{"body":"\n#\nMotivation\nIt's common for a function to have many positive and negative cases,\nwhich means it demands more testing code.\nTesting code will grow large, at some point it will be challenging to navigate and read the testing codebase.\nOrganizing unit tests will help you to maintain the testing code,\nit also lowers the mental effort maintaining the codebase, this is true\nnot only for unit tests but also applies generally.\nThese are the common goals that you can use to organize your unit tests:\n\nVisibility. Visibility means it's easy to search and navigate through the testing files.\nReadability. Readability focuses on the testing file content and structure.\n\n\n#\nVisibility: Directory and file path structure\nSome modern programming languages have conventions on organizing test directories and files, following the standard conventions should be the best thing to do.\n\nGo has a convention to put test code in a different file under the same source code directory e.g. foo.go will have test file foo_test.go\nRust has a convention to put the tests together in the file source code\n\nIf the language has no convention, I usually mirror the test file path to the source code file path.\nSuppose that you have src/finance/tax-calculator.js, there will be a test file with path test/unit/finance/tax-calculator.spec.js,\nnotice that the test file path has a different prefix and file extension with the source code file (src/* vs test/unit/*, .js vs .spec.js),\nthis is a convention that I follow because it's easier to search and keep the main codebase source directory clean.\n\n\n#\nReadability: Testing code file structure\nTesting code file structure is meant to ease navigation within the testing codebase.\nA straightforward approach that I take is to represent 1 module/class with 1 testing code file.\nWithin the file I group test cases per module function/class method, the grouping is done based on the test\nframework that you use. Grouping test cases per module function will help you to extract out\nthe test cases for that specific function, here are the examples in JS &amp; Java\n\n\n\n#\nReadability: Splitting large testing code file\nMaintaining a large testing file is challenging, it's like maintaining a code file that has thousands of lines of code,\nThere are 3 test file components that can be separated quite easily:\n\nTarget functions that are being tested.\nTesting data (fixtures).\nCommon test utilities.\n\n\n#\nSeparating unit tests per target function\nIt's generally a good idea to start splitting a large test file into multiple test files, 1 test file should cover only 1 target function/method.\nThe definition of a large test file should be similar to the definition of a large business logic module/class in your engineering team.\nI personally use 2k lines of code threshold to start the splitting.\nSuppose test/unit/finance/tax-calculator.spec.js is more than 2k lines of code and it contains 3 target functions: calculateTaxForExpat(), calculateTaxForCitizen(), and calculateTaxForSmallBusiness(). We would have 3 test files after splitting:\n\n\n#\nSeparating unit test data (fixtures)\nWhen test input data are more than 10% of the testing code, I recommend moving\nthe test data into a separate fixture file. It's easier to navigate through the testing code if the testing logic is concise.\n\n\n#\nSeparating common test utilities\nWe can separate common test logic into a separate code module/class so it's easier to reuse it.\nIf the reused test common logic is only a couple of lines and rarely reused across test cases then better to keep it within the same test file,\notherwise, we can group common logic further based on where it's reused:\n\nReused common logic in many unit test cases in the same testing file.

Suppose that you're working on a task\nto write a tax calculation function, given a salary, it will calculate the tax with rules:\n\nIf salary is below than 10k then use tax rate 15%.\nIf salary is within 10k-20k (10k &lt;= salary &lt; 20k) then use tax rate 20%.\nElse use tax rate 30%.\n\nThe easiest implementation is to cover negative cases when given a negative salary, and then continue to follow the requirements.\n\nThe negative case should have unit tests as well in an ideal situation, but suppose that you're in a very tight deadline,\nwhat I recommend is to cover the main requirements first then you could cover the unit test for the salary &lt; 0 branching because\nintuitively it's unlikely the end users would input a negative salary and if they do so accidentally they would notice it and can re-input the correct salary.\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/software-engineering/unit-testing/prioritizing-unit-test-cases/","title":"Unit Testing: Prioritizing Unit Test Cases"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/software-engineering/unit-testing/the-point-of-unit-tests/":{"body":"Most likely you've heard the term unit tests if you're in software engineering or fields related to it.\nThis post is a short introduction to the unit testing practice, starting with what is it and what's the point\nof doing it from my view, it's not meant to be super technical.\n\n#\nWhat is Unit Testing\nLike the term itself, unit testing is a practice of writing code to test your code as a \"unit\",\nit focuses on the unit logic and mocks the I/O operations and the side effects.\nFor simplicity, suppose you have a function calculateInvoiceAmount(order) that calculates the invoice amount based on\nthe given order and delivery fee data from a database. The code would look something like this\n\nIn unit testing, we'll mock (fake) fetchDeliveryFeeFromDb so it returns predefined data because we want to test the calculation logic and trust\nthe DB that it will always be reliable, this way your unit tests only focus on the invoice amount calculation logic order amount + delivery fee.\nFocusing on the logic helps us to simplify unit testing because your unit tests do not depend on the database.\n\n#\nWhat's the point of unit tests, and why it matters?\nI acknowledged that I initially just following best practices to write unit tests, no actual motivation back then.\nThe value was crystal clear after doing it a few times, there are 2 main values of writing unit tests:\n\nIt saves your time, the leverage is much larger when you have a bigger team size.\nIt helps you to write modular code.\n\n\n#\nIt saves your time (and your team!) when done well\nWriting unit tests help you to detect regression in your code. Imagine\na typical common scenario where there are functions that depend on other functions,\nhow do you know changing/adding logic wouldn't break the other functionalities?\nInvesting in unit tests will help you detect breaking changes in other parts of your code (that\nhave unit tests written), be it in other functions or in the existing function logic.\nThis will save your time to do regression tests manually and ultimately it helps you to deliver faster.\n\n#\nUnit tests ease effort for code improvements\nHaving unit tests properly invested will encourage engineers to improve or refactor a specific functionality.\nImprovements vary from dependency upgrades, optimizing approaches taken in a specific function, and many more.\nWith properly invested unit tests, it's a lot easier to catch breaking changes in the local machine\nbefore it gets deployed on remote environments (staging, production, etc). This would implicitly improve your code quality\nbecause engineers would have more confidence refactoring code that has unit tests compared to one that does not have it,\nthey know that as long as the existing unit tests (assuming it's invested properly) are green\nthen most likely the behavior and output are fulfilling the expectations.\n\n#\nUnit tests help you to write modular code\nWriting unit tests is hard if your code is not modular, you would want to mock\ndependencies or I/O in the class/function that you're testing, generally\nit's going to be a lot easier writing unit tests for a class/function where\nthe dependencies are easy to swap (with mock/fake implementation).\nWriting code with a mental note that you want to write units for it will\nindirectly forces you to make your code modular.\n\n#\nReal-life example at work\nIn 2015, we invested in a library to do generic input validation, there are 50+ validation rules\nand it's used in almost all microservices in the company.\nIt's not uncommon to have security notification to upgrade the library dependencies, luckily\nwe've already invested in unit tests for each of the validation rules both for negative and positive cases.\nUpgrading a dependency is a matter of bumping the dependency version number and running the unit tests,\nonce it's all green we can proceed to push the dependency upgrade to the main codebase.\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/software-engineering/unit-testing/the-point-of-unit-tests/","title":"Unit Testing: The Point of Unit Tests"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/software-engineering/unit-testing/your-first-step-in-unit-testing-practice-what-to-expect/":{"body":"\n#\nSet your mindset first\nI would like to remind you that you need to understand the motivation behind unit tests,\nwhy are you doing it? It's important that you're convinced because writing unit tests is an investment,\nyou will spend time doing it and you want to make sure that you invest properly to get the yield that you want.\nIf you're convinced that it's going to be worth it then read on.\n\n#\nConcept\nUnit testing is a practice of the bigger testing component. In terms of isolation there are generally 2 types of testing:\n\nUnit testing, a testing practice that focuses only on the function logic, the other dependencies are simulated. Suppose there's a function f and it depends on g and h,\nwhen unit testing f we will assume other dependencies g and h will behave correctly, this is done through \"faking\" g and h behavior in\nan isolated unit testing environment.\nFunctional testing, a testing practice that focuses on testing the end user features and flows to behave as expected, it does not fake g and h behavior\nbut rather will expect f, g, and h to work well together as a feature/flow.\n\nUnit testing is generally easier to implement and run faster because you're testing your code in an isolated environment\nwhere you can fake external service dependencies (database, redis, HTTP API dependencies, etc).\n\n#\nFirst Expectation and Setup\nJust like programming, you'll be slow at first time writing unit tests but eventually,\nyou'll get better at choosing which unit tests are worth investing in and able to do it faster hence your unit test investment will start paying dividends in terms of\nsaving your / team time. Unit test is programming language agnostic, you can apply the practice in all languages, so\nmastering unit test is a long-term investment, repeat the process over and over again and you’ll get better.\nYour first step is to find a test library that supports unit tests, some examples\n\nRust 👉 the testing component is baked into the language, so you can just write unit tests right away without an external library.\nJavascript 👉 you could install mocha as the test runner and chai to set assertions/expectations\nSwift 👉 there's XCtest bundled with the official Swift Package Manager.\nPHP 👉 the most popular one is PHP Unit\n\n\n#\nCommon Components in unit testing\nJust mastering the common components will get you far in unit testing,\nmost of them are quite basic and should cover most of your use cases in software engineering,\nexpect that you'll deal mostly with these components in your unit testing journey.\n\n#\nTest Doubles / Fake Dependencies\n\n#\nStub\nA stub is a dependency replacement that has been pre-programmed with a set of expectations,\nthey are intended to be used as test double. For a simple explanation, imagine that you have a method calculateTax that\ndepends on some configuration in a database\n\nIn unit testing, we'll focus on testing just the logic to calculate salary, this is done by simulating the surrounding environment,\nwe would create an instance of pre-programmed TaxConfigQuery that will return predefined tax configs and inject it (pass as argument)\nto the calculateTax method.\n\n#\nMock\nMock is a stricter version of stub, you can set more advanced expectations on mock objects. For example\nyou could check how many times a method has been called or whether it's been called with specific arguments.\nBased on my experience it's useful when you have expectations that some critical functions should/should not have\nbeen called for n times (could be 0, 1, and so on), such expectations are critical to be verified\nwhen testing idempotent operations or testing a logic with a retry mechanism.\n\n#\nSpy\nSpy is a test double that acts like a wrapper/proxy to the real instance, it's typically used\nwhen we want to monitor or intercept a method call and then record something before calling the real method.\nI usually use them for logging and debugging purposes.\n\n#\nIntegration Component\n\n#\nTest reports\nTest report generate test results statistics that you can analyze,\nyou would need to install an external dependency because it's usually a separate component of the test framework/library.\nMost common usage of test reports:\n\nStandard test results output, but rendered more aesthetically pleasing ✨\nCalculate how much % test coverage in your codebase\n\n\n#\nAutomated tests\nUsually unit testing framework has a CLI command to run it,\nit's a common  practice to  setup a CI pipeline to run unit tests on certain events,\nthe most common ones:\n\nRun unit tests when there's a pull request.\nRun unit tests when a pull request is merged into the master/main/testing/production branch.\n\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/software-engineering/unit-testing/your-first-step-in-unit-testing-practice-what-to-expect/","title":"Unit Testing: Your first step in unit testing, what to expect"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/software-engineering/why-documentation-matters/":{"body":"Imagine buying a washing machine but it has no manual book, would you be happy?\nYou'd do fine if you have prior experience with a similar machine, but what if you don't?\n\n#\nSoftware Engineering Documentation\nSame as software engineering/software product documentation, it matters a lot.\nMany years ago, I was naive, I used to think that documentation was not really valuable,\nup until more people joining the team, everyone started to wonder why the code was written that way and how would we test the code.\nLet's start with the most obvious example, suppose there are new joiners in your team\nand they want to set up a work laptop, they will ask you since there's no documentation on what to set up.\nHow long would it take for you to help them? 5 minutes on average per new joiner?\nIf you have 10 new joiners it'll add up to maybe ~30-50 minutes, if you're loyal\nmaybe you'll go through an employee turnover cycle and there will be more new joiners.\nIt would be a lot easier if you had a document on how to set up a work laptop, bonus point\nif you can automate it because it will save more time for your team members as well, you still\nneed to document how to run the automation though and add a common troubleshooting guide.\nSo documentation is kind of a leverage for you and other people and when done right,  it saves a lot of time 💰!\n\n#\nDocumentation Mental Model\n\nNot everything is worth documenting, look at the pattern in your workplace and decide on things that are worth documenting.\nThe more you defer documentation, the more you'll get dragged by other people, the same goes both ways.\nOutdated documentation is the same, if not worse than having no documentation. It misleads people.\nThe more detailed your documentation is, the more likely it'll go outdated, pick a balance.\nIf it's a critical part of the software then be as detailed as possible, you need to balance with risk of outdated documentation.\nSoftware critical parts usually have more than 1 person who knows about it, so you can cover each other to make sure the documentation is up to date.\n\n\n#\nIs It Worth Documenting?\nDocumentation is an investment, you need to choose which one to invest, not everything is worth documenting.\nI have my own personal heuristics on things that are worth to document:\n\nRepetitive manual work that cannot be automated/need manual intervention. It's a lot easier to delegate if you have documentation.\nThings that are less likely to change but often being asked. For example, high level guides of\nservice common components (secret engine, query layer, business logic layer, etc.) that explain how\nthe components interact with each other.\nPost mortem docs, past mistakes and incidents because mostly we can learn something from it\nand something in the past is constant.\nThings that are commonly asked by my collagues. For example\n\nWho owns service X? I have an excel contains a service ownership map.\nDo you have a link to Y? I have an excel that contains common bookmarks a.k.a the yellow page.\n\n\nTroubleshooting guide.

It'll be handy if we can copy the file path to system clipboard.\n\nNow everytime you press F10 in normal mode, it will automatically register file path to current active file\nin buffer to your system clipboard.\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/vim/copy-file-path-from-project-root/","title":"Vim Copy File Path From Project Root"},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/war-stories/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/war-stories/","title":""},"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/war-stories/accidentally-ran-a-database-update-without-where-clause/":{"body":"What Happened\nBack in 2019 I was in a very good mood that the product launch was quite smooth in the past months.\nI got report that there were calculation bugs affecting some of the data. The bug was reproducible locally, I skimmed at the code and just kind of knew where the miscalculation happened in the code,\nmy confident was high and my coffee tasted good on that day!\nLong story short, I submitted the bug fix to be reviewed and then deployed\nthe fix to our testing environment. I tested it manually in concurrent to the QA testing process, the fix worked\nwell on test environment and I deployed it directly to the prod, the fix was confirmed to work on production as well,\nI could see incoming data was calculated correctly.\nAs the finisher, I move forward to update the old data that was incorrect prior the fix.\nI was already in the company network, so I connected to the database through psql\nand start writing the update statement. I couldn't remember what was going on in my mind but\nI typed the closing semicolon as soon as I reached the update statement, I had not typed the filter, it was the\nworst thing that could happen.\n\nI didn't even notice, looking at my sql statement that I ran, it was kind of hanging there on psql 🤨. It's just like your typical query when it's processing a lot of data then\nit returned the updated rows, showing tens of thousands of data had been updated, this was a small DB, but still tens of thousands is a lot to\nfix.\nThankfully I was able to pull a quick sql to update all the data again, I was lucky that I applied DML that's easy to reverse.\n\nPutting cherry on the top, there was no new data coming in. The query worked and\nI can still keep my job, also big thanks to my coffee that I made for myself.\nCompleting the day, I wrote the query with the filter (where clause) first then the DML to complete the day\nwith a very good lesson that I keep up until now.\nWhat Went Wrong and Lesson Learned\nFor reflection, here are the list that could've been done better:\n\nData update should run in a database transaction so we can rollback in case unexpected things happen, in my case it should be possible because we're using Postgres.\nIt's not gonna hurt to ask peers to review the SQL statement before running it.\nTest the SQL query in local machine or in testing environment.\nIf for whatever reason we need to write the SQL statement directly in production then it's a lot safer to filter/where statement first.\n\n","id":"https://blog.wavvel.com/posts/war-stories/accidentally-ran-a-database-update-without-where-clause/","title":"War Story: Accidentally Ran A Database Update
