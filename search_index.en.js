we just had intense integrations with our business partners.\nWe have a whitelabel product where registered whitelabel partners can use our core engine\nand put their brand as the label.\n\n  \n\nThe development was very intense because there are some parts that need to be customized\nfor each partners and some of the APIs are not even 100% finished yet. We do the development both ways,\npartners also allocated engineering resource on their side to help with the integration.\nDuring this intense moment, we made some mistakes, both engineering related and non engineering.\nThis post is about the lessons/key takeaways from the experience.\nI'll update the post regularly as the learning process continues, stay tuned!\n\n\n#\nUnix timestamp for all datetime API parameters\nAs of now we're using iso datetime format\nfor datetime fields, it's very likely that your API clients are using a different\nprogramming language / library and the tool that they choose is going to behave differently.\nAt the end unixtimestamp is the most general way to pass datetime data.\n\n#\nsnake_case instead of camelCase for API fields\nWe had multiple integration problems when partners had typo. Let's face it,\neveryone has this experience where you mistype the camelCase format,\ne.g. someField -&gt; somefield. Using snake_case should reduce the possibility\nof the problem thus would save your client's time and your time when doing integration.\n\n#\nUse \"sprint\" as the development estimation time unit\nThere will be times where both parties agrees on to develop new features, depending on the urgency,\nif it's a not a critical feature then I'd advise to always use n sprint as the time estimation.\nThe new non-critical feature takes 4 hours to complete? Set the estimation to 1 sprint,\nif it takes &gt; 50% of sprint points then say it takes 2 sprints. Development is not just\nabout code-complete, it's about delivering the features that meet the expectation\nwith minimum bugs and 0 critical bug, probably you need to update your API docs too.\n\n#\nHandling major changes/decisions\nMake sure major changes/decisions will be discussed internally first, there will be different\npoint of views, from product, UI/UX, engineering. Anything related to the major decisions should be answered with Let us discuss internally first, we'll get back to you by X day(s)\n\n#\nRemember, it's a partnership\nThis is a partnership, it's a relationship where we will work together as a partner for\nmutual benefits, it's not a stage to throw mistakes, it's a stage to perform together\nand achieve great things together. Having this mindset will help your emotion and stress level in check.\n","id":"https://sendyhalim.github.io/blog/posts/development-practices/partnership-system-integration-tips/","title":"Partnership System Integration Tips"},"https://sendyhalim.github.io/blog/posts/development-practices/practical-programming-principles/":{"body":"There are many programming paradigms, many approaches to code, new tools and frameworks, well things are moving fast 🏎 💨!\nI hope this post can be something to be held on when considering programming and development standard.\nUsually the considerations will be useful when starting a new project, when there are arguments on\nhow to approach things in development,, which tool/framework to use. Pick whatever you think is suitable for your project &amp; team, take it with a grain of salt.\nHaving these principles in mind has helped my team to:\n\nMake programming decisions: how to structure code, how to handle errors.\nDecide when should we opt-in for a hack and what's the minimum proper way to apply a \"quickfix\".\nDecide when to invest more in documentations.\n\n\n#\nReadability\nReadability means it's easy to understand, not just easy to read. Easy to understand meaning might vary\nbecause each company/team has their own engineering skills standard. Having a readability standard set earlier will boost\nteam productivity in the longer run, it'll cut communication cost, reduce time needed to understand the code and hence improve engineer onboarding process.\n\n#\n[Readability] Static type\nIf possible it might be worth the investment to use statically typed language. Code is meant to be read more than it is written,\nstatic typing will improve readability. Compiler will help you eliminate most of the compile-time type errors, this would simplify unit testing, you don't need to test data type unless your project requires you to do a lot runtime type check which is might be another sign of a problem.\n\n#\n[Readability] Code comment\nCode comment meant to be used as explanation of some approach, usually explaining \"why\" certain logic is set that way.\nThe goal is to help your peers and \"future you\" to understand the code either in code review or when we want to revisit the code in the future. Cases where code comment is beneficial:\nA. Complex logic.\nB. Motivation regarding unorthodox approach.\nC. Hack/quickfix, this would reduce confusion a lot and make it explicit that the approach that's considered a \"hackfix\" is intended.\n\n#\n[Readability] Be explicit enough\nBe explicit enough, set the acceptable standard of explicitness with your team.\nObvious examples would be related with variable naming:\nA. Use plural for list, vector or array type.\nlet emails: Vec&lt;String&gt;;\nlet users: Vec&lt;User&gt;;\nlet people: Vec&lt;Person&gt;;\n\nB. Use {value}_by_{type} naming pattern for key-value data structure (hashmap, btreemap, dictionary, etc)\n// You'll get a user given an email\nlet userByEmail: HashMap&lt;String, User&gt;;\n\n// You'll get users given a name, maybe you're grouping users by their first name\nlet usersByFirstName: HashMap&lt;String, Vec&lt;User&gt;&gt;;\n\n\n#\n[Readability] Limit on maximum number of characters per line.\nImagine you're reading a book, you need to scroll both vertically &amp; horizontally\nto read a paragraph because there's no maximum number of characters per line,\nwould it be a good user experience? The same goes for writing code, imagine a line of code\nthat you need to scroll both directions a lot, easier to just scroll vertically right?\n\n#\nModularity\nModular means it's easy to plug &amp; change something because there's a balanced abstraction. Note that in practice, you do not have to abstract everything,\ntoo much abstraction would be make it less readable and harder to understand. It\nwould make the most sense to put abstraction on top of something that would likely to change or\nsomething that already has/will have multiple implementations.\nOne easy example: suppose we want to send\nSMS(maybe for MFA use cases - OTP) to our users, putting an interface on top of the actual vendor\nimplementation might be a good idea, why? Let's start with the business use case, MFA is a critical security feature, having a good OTP delivery rate is crucial for the user experience, we\ncan't rely only to 1 vendor, it's important to have at least another SMS vendor backup in case the the primary vendor is down or there are other problems (latency drops or the delivery rate drops).\nIf we put an interface for it, it's easy to switch. The switch strategy might vary, it could be via a circuit breaker mechanism or just a simple remote config to decide which SMS vendor to use.\nA bit intermezzo, use TOTP might be more secure than OTP.\nThere's a signal that you could use to measure modularity, if it's relatively easy\nto write unit tests then most probably your code is modular enough because it's easy\nto inject dependencies (mock objects in unit test context) and hence will make it easier to refactor things if needed.\n\n#\nDebuggability\nPlease note that this part needs to be supported with observability which is part of\nsystem monitoring and outside the scope of this post, this section assumes you have reasonable observability of your system. No one wants their code to throw errors, but life happens.\nThe easier it is to debug the error, the faster it is to resolve the problem.\nSome of the key points to measure your debuggability:\n\nHow easy is it to be alerted when there are errors. Do you know your error rate in production?\nHow easy is it to prioritize error? We should be able to separate errors by its severity, errors that block users to do payment should be more important than errors related with changing username.\nError handling, do we let errors go into limbo? Do we have a clear separation on what's actually considered as an error?\nError message, do we construct meaningful error message? or is it just printing \"System Error\"?\n\n","id":"https://sendyhalim.github.io/blog/posts/development-practices/practical-programming-principles/","title":"Practical Programming Principles"},"https://sendyhalim.github.io/blog/posts/development-practices/tips-on-technical-design-doc/":{"body":"Having to write a technical design doc(TDD) is a prerequisite of a medium-high feature development/refactoring initiative at Cermati, it's part of the planning process.\nYou need make sure that the team &amp; stakeholders agree on the technical plan/initiative that you want to achieve, this is done through a design doc review process by your CTO/Managers/Stakeholders.\nIt's an essential part of the planning process because it brings people together, especially the team and stakeholders. Get the buy in, distribute the tasks, execute the plan and have cookies 🍪🍪!\nThe post will cover some of the tips that hopefully will help you to write better TDD.\nJust like writing code, the easier it is to understand, the easier it is to review, save time and make your team &amp; stakeholders happy 🍻.\n\n#\n1. Show the current state in the Background section\nAssume your reviewers do not know anything about the current state or just assume they're not up to date.\nFeel free to put links to other existing docs as well. I find it using diagram flow helps a lot to get people catch up with the current state.\nFree tools that you can use:\n\ndiagrams.net\nMermaidJS\n\n\n#\n2. Continue with problem statement\nExplain why you're proposing the initiative. Why does it matter?\nWhat impact will it bring? Maybe answering any of the below question would help you to set the impact:\n\nWill it increase company's North Star metric either directly or indirectly?\nWill it reduce cost of a tool that we use?\nAre you investing for future needs? Why that specific investment matters?\nThe current process that we have might have pain points and you want to improve it to increase employee/team productivity.\n\n\n#\n3. Show the available options/solutions that we have\nResearching the available options that we have and mentioning the pros and cons of each option will clear up a lot of things. This will save up a lot of time and help you get the buy in quicker.\nThe available options also make it easier for us to get back here quickly in case we chose to pursue the wrong option.\n\n#\n4. What are the actionables &amp; timelines\nEach team have different missions, even though the end goals should align company's goals, mentioning all of the actionables/tasks give more\naccurate timeline estimation. Set the PIC as well, it could be a team(in which the team lead will delegate the tasks) or an individual contributor.\nMake sure all the PICs agree on the timeline and put it in the document.\n\n#\n5. What's your backup plan\nThings could fail even with an almost perfect plan, what's your revert/backup plan?\nIf a migration plan fails, what should we do? Is there a way to turn back? If there's a way, should we continue with the risk or is there anything that we should do?\nWhat's the step of the revert/backup plan? Who's going to execute it?\nAnother case with product engineering, if what we plan does not meet the deadline, what are non-essentials features that we can cut? Can we move them into the next iterations?\n\n#\n6. Gather feedback\nThere's no perfect plan, open feedback session and verify their concerns. It's not uncommon for the planner to miss some things due to lack of visibility and deadline to write the plan,\nthe lack of visibility usually comes due to fast moving parts within certain parts of the process, for example you're reading a code that's under development by other team.\nDon't worry too much, that's why you should have the technical design doc review meeting 🖖.

A typical workflow for submitting &amp; merging your feature:\n\nCreate a new feature branch based on master branch, develop and git commit locally from there.\nSubmit code review arc diff when we're done.\nRun arc land to merge our diff to remote master branch.\n\narc land will squash all of the commits into 1 commit on the feature branch, it uses diff title and description as the commit message. We can also simulate arc land manually, maybe not 100% exact though:\n\ngit checkout master to make sure local master branch is up to date.\ngit checkout &lt;feature-branch&gt;\ngit rebase master -i and squash all of the &lt;feature-branch&gt; commits into 1 commit on top of master branch.\nMerge the rebased &amp; squashed feature branch to remote master.\nCheckout to master and pull origin master.\n\nThis typical flow works if we work on separate features at the same time, but it could fail if we try to develop feature on top of other feature that's still in code review (submitted to phabricator). There are many cases this failure could happen, one of the frequent one is when we develop feature-b on top of feature-a where feature-a is still in code review.\n\n#\nSimulation\nWe'll be using this repo as example.\nAssumptions:\nM = master\nFA = feature a\nFB = feature b\n\nmx&lt;n&gt; = commit on master branch\nax&lt;n&gt; = commit on feature-a branch\nbx&lt;n&gt; = commit on feature-b branch\n\nThe condition will look like below:\n\nmaster branch: 3 commits mx1, mx2, and mx3.\nfeature-a branch: 2 commits ax1 and ax2.\nfeature-b branch: 3 commits bx1, bx2 and bx3, it's  built on top of feature-a.\n\nmx1---mx2---mx3---&gt; [M]\n               \\\n                ax1---ax2---&gt; [FA]\n                         \\\n                          bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\n\n#\nArc land feature-a branch\nLet's say that your feature-a is accepted via code review process and you do arc land, it'll squash commits ax1 and ax2 into 1 commit.\n# Process view\n# S = squash\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---&gt; [M]\n               \\         /---bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n                ax1---ax2---&gt; [FA]\n                 |     |\n                 S     S\n# End result\n# There's a new commit \"ax\" that represents commit ax1 and ax2.\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---ax---&gt; [M]\n               \\\n                ax1---ax2---bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\nfeature-b doesn't need ax1 and ax2 because it's already represented by ax. It will fail if you've submitted feature-b for code review and do arc land, the reason is because it could not merge \"cleanly\". The fix is actually pretty easy, you need to point commit bx1 to ax. We will do git rebase to rewrite the history, PLEASE BACKUP feature-b first before you do this, you can do it by checking-out out from feature-b to another branch.\ngit checkout feature-b\n\n# Backup for safety\ngit checkout -b feature-b-backup\n\n\n#\nRewriting history\nFirst, make sure that we're on feature-b and then we will run rebase interactive to drop commits ax1 and ax2.\nIt should be safe because both commits are already in master (represented by ax commit).\n# Do interactive rebase onto master\n# --------------------\ngit rebase -i master\n\nThere will be an editor prompt that should look like\npick 233a9b8 ax1\npick 5f5e3ce ax2\npick e145774 bx1\npick 1834f7d bx2\npick 95d155a bx3\n\nYou have 2 options remove ax1 and ax2:\n\nDelete the lines\nReplace pick with drop\n\nYou can do either one but I'll go with drop to make it more explicit in this post\ndrop 233a9b8 ax1\ndrop 5f5e3ce ax2\npick e145774 bx1\npick 1834f7d bx2\npick 95d155a bx3\n\nSave your changes and quit editor, the rebase process will continue by itself.\nNow your feature-b should point to the latest commit on local master branch, you can verify this via git log or use a GUI tool.\ngit log --oneline --decorate --color --graph\n\n# End result\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---ax---&gt; [M]\n                    \\\n                     bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\nThat's it, now you can do arc land cleanly.

In this case you take the responsibility. Yes, the team lead is responsible for the project, even though you should held people accountable.\nJust like a CEO is responsible for the overall success of a company, team lead is responsible for the overall success of a team.\nIn most cases your manager will require a report of what failed and what can be improved. Take it as a learning to get better! You can do it together with your team, remember to back-up each other!\n\nThe basic principle to keep in mind: if you fail then you get up together with the team and improve.\n\n","id":"https://sendyhalim.github.io/blog/posts/team/engineering-lead-achieving-team-goals/","title":"Engineering Lead - Achieving Team Goals"},"https://sendyhalim.github.io/blog/posts/terminal/":{"body":"","id":"https://sendyhalim.github.io/blog/posts/terminal/","title":""},"https://sendyhalim.github.io/blog/posts/terminal/living-in-the-terminal/":{"body":"Most of my time is spent in the terminal and I love working within it,\nso I invest a lot for the best terminal setup to make sure that I'm productive and happy when I'm using it.\nHere's a couple of screenshots of my terminal\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nHere's the must have list for the best terminal experience\n\niTerm2\nTmux\nNeovim\n\nLet's start with iTerm2, it's the go to terminal when you're using macOS and does not like\nthe built-in terminal that macOS has.
