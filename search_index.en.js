This post assumes that you've known git rebase and phabricator terms.\nWe use phabricator as our code review tool at Cermati. A typical workflow for submitting &amp; merging your feature:\n\nCreate new branch based on master branch, develop and git commit locally from there.\nSubmit code review arc diff when we're done.\nDo arc land to merge our diff to remote master branch\n\nCommand arc land will squash all of our commits into 1 commit on our feature branch, it will use diff title and description as the commit message. We can also simulate arc land manually, maybe not 100% exact though:\n\ngit checkout master to make sure local master branch is up to date.\ngit checkout &lt;feature-branch&gt;\ngit rebase master -i and squash all of the &lt;feature-branch&gt; commits into 1 commit on top of master branch.\nMerge the rebased &amp; squashed feature branch to remote master.\nCheckout to master and pull origin master.\n\nThis typical flow works if we work on separate features at the same time, but it could fail if we try to develop feature on top of other feature that's still in code review (submitted to phabricator). There are many cases this failure could happen, one of the frequent one is when we develop feature-b on top of feature-a where feature-a is still in code review.\n\n#\nSimulation\nAssumptions:\nM = master\nFA = feature a\nFB = feature b\n\nmx&lt;n&gt; = commit on master branch\nax&lt;n&gt; = commit on feature-a branch\nbx&lt;n&gt; = commit on feature-b branch\n\nThe condition will look like below:\n\nmaster branch: 3 commits mx1, mx2, and mx3.\nfeature-a branch: 2 commits ax1 and ax2.\nfeature-b branch: 3 commits bx1, bx2 and bx3, it's  built on top of feature-a.\n\nmx1---mx2---mx3---&gt; [M]\n               \\\n                ax1---ax2---&gt; [FA]\n                         \\\n                          bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\n\n#\nArc land feature-a branch\nLet's say that your feature-a is accepted via code review process and you do arc land, it'll squash commits ax1 and ax2 into 1 commit.\n# Process view\n# S = squash\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---&gt; [M]\n               \\         /---bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n                ax1---ax2---&gt; [FA]\n                 |     |\n                 S     S\n# End result\n# There's a new commit \"ax\" that represents commit ax1 and ax2.\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---ax---&gt; [M]\n               \\\n                ax1---ax2---bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\nfeature-b shouldn't need ax1 and ax2 because it's already represented by ax. It will fail if you've submitted feature-b for code review and do arc land, the reason is because it could not merge \"cleanly\". The fix is actually pretty easy, you need to point commit bx1 to ax. We will do git rebase to rewrite the history, PLEASE BACKUP feature-b first before you do this, you can do it by checking-out out from feature-b to another branch.\ngit checkout feature-b\n\n# Backup for safety\ngit checkout -b feature-b-backup\n\n\n#\nRewriting history\nFirst, make sure that we're on feature-b.\n# We will only rebase bx1, bx2, and bx3 onto master\n# because we do not need commit ax1 and ax2 here.\n# Notice we use \"ax2\" as our current base,\n# this is because \"git rebase --onto master\" uses range (ax2, bx3], so \"ax2\" is exclusive.\n# --------------------\ngit rebase --onto master ax2 bx3\n\nNow your feature-b should point to the latest commit on local master branch, you can verify this via git log or use a GUI tool.\ngit log --oneline --decorate --color --graph\n\n# End result\n# --------------------\nmx1---mx2---mx3---ax---&gt; [M]\n                    \\\n                     bx1---bx2---bx3---&gt; [FB]\n\nThat's it, now you can do arc land safely.
