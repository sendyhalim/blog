    <h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2>
<p>Back in 2019 I was in a very good mood that the product launch was quite smooth in the past months.
I got report that there were calculation bugs affecting some of the data. The bug was reproducible locally, I skimmed at the code and just kind of knew where the miscalculation happened in the code,
my confident was high and my coffee tasted good on that day!</p>
<p>Long story short, I submitted the bug fix to be reviewed and then deployed
the fix to our testing environment. I tested it manually in concurrent to the QA testing process, the fix worked
well on test environment and I deployed it directly to the prod, the fix was confirmed to work on production as well,
I could see incoming data was calculated correctly.</p>
<p>As the finisher, I move forward to update the old data that was incorrect prior the fix.
I was already in the company network, so I connected to the database through psql
and start writing the update statement. I couldn't remember what was going on in my mind but
I typed the closing semicolon as soon as I reached the update statement, I had not typed the filter, it was the
worst thing that could happen.</p>
<pre><code>update a_table set x = x * 1.1; -- &lt;enter&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't even notice, looking at my sql statement that I ran, it was kind of hanging there on psql 🤨. It's just like your typical query when it's processing a lot of data then
it returned the updated rows, showing tens of thousands of data had been updated, this was a small DB, but still tens of thousands is a lot to
fix.</p>
<p>Thankfully I was able to pull a quick sql to update all the data again, I was lucky that I applied DML that's easy to reverse.</p>
<pre><code>update a_table set x = x &#x2F; 1.1; -- &lt;enter&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Putting cherry on the top, there was no new data coming in. The query worked and
I can still keep my job, also big thanks to my coffee that I made for myself.
Completing the day, I wrote the query with the filter (where clause) first then the DML to complete the day
with a very good lesson that I keep up until now.</p>
<h2 id="what-went-wrong-and-lesson-learned">What Went Wrong and Lesson Learned</h2>
<p>For the reflection, what I can think of that went wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>I should've asked for sql review from my peers.</li>
<li>I should've written the filter first before doing any mutations.</li>
</ul>
<p>From that day on, I always ask for a sql review and always write filter,
this is a very good lesson and I'm very grateful for it.
I hope you learn something from the war story.</p>
