I had a good laugh today. The story is, I went to a mall in Jakarta for a dinner.
Dinner was good, got plenty of carbs to spent, I decided to look around and see
if I can get a good deal / discount on T-shirts~

I saw this flashy `"Buy 1 get 1 free"` thing printed on a storefront,
I went in and saw a kid (let's call it Bill for simplicity's sake, shall we?)
staring at a male mannequin wearing short pants. I didn't know what happened, but I felt
dark aura surrounding Bill and somehow he jumped and debagged that male mannequin.

<div class="image-container">

    src="/images/life/funny/debagging-of-the-day/debagged-mannequin.jpg"
    alt="Debagged Mannequin"
    class="medium-size">
</div>

I lost it, lol-ed so hard, Bill noticed me and I told him, no don't do that to me lol,
then that he ran to his parents.
