Let's structure it to 3 big components
* Tools Requirements
* Hardware
* Software

# Tools Requirements
I'm kind of frugal in terms of paying for tools, I wouldn't spend money unless it satisfies the following requirements:
* The tools must save my time.
* It should be long lasting, either it's already proven to be long lasting or at the very minimum there must be a company that supports it.
* There's no other good free option that could save my time.


# Hardware
#### Keyboard
* Logitech MK275 - [Tokopedia](https://tokopedia.link/qirzFnuLwCb), I like it, it's cheap and works well.
* Keychron K2 - [Tokopedia](https://tokopedia.link/1BSfq6lLwCb),  got it as a gift on my 28th birthday.

#### Laptop
* Macbook Pro Retina 15 inch, going to replace it soon.
* Vertical Laptop Stand (Alumunium) - [Tokopedia](https://tokopedia.link/7JJtv6iMwCb).

#### Monitor
I'm using a 24 inch Dell, unfortunately I forgot the link, but I recall that I bought it in 2017 for around ~$170 and it's still ok up until now.

# Software
Most of the software tools that I use are mostly free..

#### Code Editor & IDE
* [Vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), I'm using the NeoVim variant, I use it by default for any development and practically all text editing (even writing this blog).
* [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (Community Edition), nothing beats Intellij + vim keybindings plugin for JVM based development.

#### Terminal
I'm in the shell terminal for most of my software engineering activities, say for example I use native database CLIs to browse database
because I'm already comfortable with them (psql, mysql cli, etc) and I'm confident they will be long lasting.

* [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) for the terminal GUI, I like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language, so why not use a terminal built with rust-lang.
* [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) as terminal multiplexer. Not sure what was the initial motivation for choosing tmux, in 2015 I just saw my collague use it then been using it since then.

#### Others
* Google Chrome
* Google Calendar
