This post is structured into 3 big components
* Tools Requirements
* Hardware
* Software

# Tools Requirements
I'm of frugal in terms of paying for tools, I wouldn't spend money unless it satisfies the following requirements:
* The tools must save my time.
* It should be long lasting, either it's already proven to be long lasting or at the very minimum there must be a company behind the tool that's supporting it.
* There's no other good free option that could save my time.


# Hardware
#### Keyboard
* Logitech MK275 - [Tokopedia](https://tokopedia.link/qirzFnuLwCb), I like it, it's cheap and works well.
* Keychron K2 - [Tokopedia](https://tokopedia.link/1BSfq6lLwCb),  got it as a gift on my 28th birthday.

#### Laptop
* Macbook Pro Retina 15 inch, going to replace it soon with a macbook air.
* Vertical Laptop Stand (Alumunium) - [Tokopedia](https://tokopedia.link/7JJtv6iMwCb).

#### Monitor
I'm using a 24 inch Dell, unfortunately I forgot the link, but I recall that I bought it in 2017 for around ~$170 and it's still delivering pixels.

# Software
Most of the software tools that I use are mostly free.

#### Code Editor & IDE * [Vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), I'm using the NeoVim variant, I use it by default for any development and practically all text editing (even writing this blog).
* [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (Community Edition), nothing beats Intellij + vim keybindings plugin for JVM based development.

#### Terminal
I'm in the shell terminal for most of my software engineering activities, for example I use native database CLIs to browse database
because I'm already comfortable with them (psql, mysql cli, etc) and I'm confident they will be long lasting, so learning
other GUI tools might not be worth it, I'd rather spend my time to learn other software engineering fundamentals.

* [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) for the terminal GUI, I like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language, so why not use a terminal built with it.
* [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) as terminal multiplexer, not sure what was the initial motivation for choosing tmux, in 2015 I saw my collague used it and it works well.

#### Others
* Google Chrome
* Google Calendar
* [Trello](https://trello.com)
