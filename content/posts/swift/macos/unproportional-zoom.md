I had this weird problem when I tried to implement a zoom functionality
in my hobby project, a manga reader called [Yomu](https://github.com/sendyhalim/yomu).
When I tried to zoom an `NSImageView` programmatically
it's being zoomed unproportionally, my expectation was the image should be stretched horizontally
and vertically without moving from its center point. It was like this

<h5 class="text-center">Zoom 100%</h5>
<p class="image-container">
  <img
    src="/assets/images/swift/image-view/unproportional-zoom/zoom-100.png"
    alt="NSImageView unproportional zoom">
</p>


<h5 class="text-center">Zoom 140%</h5>
<p class="image-container">
  <img
    src="/assets/images/swift/image-view/unproportional-zoom/zoom-140.png"
    alt="NSImageView unproportional zoom">
</p>


Damn, there was an ugly gap :( between header border and the image.
I had a hard time finding the solution, it took me almost 3 days to debug this problem (maybe because I'm a newbie).
It turns out the solution is really simple, by default apple will set image view to scale proportionally down,
changing it to proportionally up or down will fix the problem.
