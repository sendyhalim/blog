I'm siding on 1 of the most unpopular opinions when developing something: writing tests.
I believe there are many devs out there that hate me because
I require them to write tests on some critical parts of their code, I can live with that.

Lately I've been really questioning myself, is it really worth it? So far, there's practical and impractical reasons why I write tests:
* It's easy to fix bugs and refactor some of the internal logics.
* I feel like something is missing when I don't write tests,
  this drives me really impractical in some cases.
  I always do it if I have time, just to scratch the itch even if I know it's impractical

Recently our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/osumampouw/" target="_blank">CTO</a>
forwarded a security alert to one of the company's open source project
called <a href="https://github.com/cermati/satpam" target="_blank">satpam</a>,
my awesome collague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-stevelino-970180102/" target="_blank">Albert Stevelino</a>
reacted quickly to the security issues and submitted a pull request to bump some of the project [dependencies](https://github.com/cermati/satpam/pull/100/files).

This might seem trivial, but those of you that have swum on the dependencies ecosystem know that even a minor patch could
pop bugs anywhere, a simple job to bump dependencies could drag down your entire weekend *evil laughs.

Satpam has <a href="https://travis-ci.org/github/cermati/satpam/builds/671509439" target="_blank">test cases</a>
baked into it, it doesn't have 100% coverage, but the tests are at "enough" level to
cover normal positive and negative cases. Plus Albert is bumping the project version,
so people should be aware of the changes. How do we make sure the project is fine?

How do we make sure the project is fine on a specific node version?

Moral of the story, just write tests if you have time, pay your taxes and you should do fine.
