I recently just noticed that basically everything has a structure, and I've been trying to
optimally structure everything before moving to execution phase, this applies in general not just in work environment.
Maybe I'm late to notice it, but better than never ðŸ¤ž.
I'm sharing what I currently have in mind regarding this, I hope this post can help you to structure executions and be more effective.

## Structure in general
Having a structure will guide us to execute effectively in a methodical manner.
In fact, structure can be seen on almost everything in our daily life ðŸ˜²!
Starting on human body that consists of a specific skeleton structure to protect and support us,
cars generally have 4 wheels as the standard structure to be able to move well, programming languages have their own syntax structure, and many more.


## Structure in Problem Solving
#### Initial thoughts
Poblem solving approach can have structure as well, though it might differ for everyone.
Just for example, a simple structure of problem solving could look something this:
1. Problem background, make sure we understand the context and problem first, make sure it exists, this can be done by reading user feedback, looking at the data, etc.
2. Problem priority, the problem may exist but it's better if we evaluate whether it's worth it to solve, afterall we already have many problems to solve right? If it's worth it then evaluate and set the problem priority.
   Typically we want to solve the higher priority problems first, starting with the easiest ones if there are problems with same priorities.
3. Problem delegation, suppose we decide to solve it, do we have the capacity? Can it be delegated?
4. Solution, is the problem something that's quite common? Do we have existing solution that we can use or should we find our own solution?
5. Execution, just get it done âœ….

#### Decompose the problem
Unless it's straightforward, problem typically can be decomposed into simpler subproblems. Those subproblems
probably can be broken down into another subproblems, the depth depends on how big the problem is and how would you balance it.
Try to find the balance, if it's too small then probably we'll end up spending unnecessary time to break it down instead of
actually solving the problem, if it's too big then the execution might be suboptimal due to overwhelming assignment.

What I find is, generally it's easier to break down problems based on skillset required to solve it because it'll easier to
delegate to team/people of a specific role.

## Example
#### Example in work environment
Suppose we have evaluated that it's worth it to launch a new software product (a problem worth to solve), the _assignment structure_ could be divided into:
* Product management -> assign to Product team
* UI & flow component -> assign to UI/UX team
* Development component -> assign to Engineering team
* Marketing component -> assign to Marketing team

Each of the team could break down the assignment into multiple subproblems down until we
think it's quite optimal, development team could divide development effort into:
* Backend Team
* Android Team
* iOS Team
* Engineering Infra Team, maybe we need to spin more servers.

Following up on _assignment structure_, each of the team could have its own _execution structure_, it doesn't have to follow the same structure
because the way to solve the subproblem could differ. Engineering team typically use agile methodology meanwhile marketing might use other approach.

#### Example in life
I would like have vacation to Japan with my family, the top level structure to get to the goal would be:
* Vacation dates
* Itinerary
* Budget planning

Same with other problems, we can break each point into subproblems/checklist, vacation dates could be broken down into:
* Find out range of dates with low workload
* Get buy-in from family
* Get annual leave approval

Itinerary probably the easiest to delegate, if I don't have time I'll just reuse itineraries made by other people.

## Key takeaways
* Not every problem is worth to solve, try to prioritize
* When thereâ€™s a problem try to think about the solution structure first then break it down into subproblems until it's quite optimal, then follow the structure and move towards the solution.
* If it's too much for you, always consider to delegate the subproblems, especially the ones that can be run in parallel.
