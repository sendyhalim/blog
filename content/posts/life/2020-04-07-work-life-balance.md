The popular buzzword in the startup life is "work life balance", even my friends often asks "how's worklife balance at your current company?".
Open ended question, no right answer, it's 100% subjective in my perspective.
Different person within 1 team would have different answer, my teammate would say "it's balanced", I'd say "it's not balanced at all" if I was in his shoes and vice-versa.

My typical work day before Covid-19 pandemic starts at 11:00AM, if I get up earlier I'd arrive at the office at 10:15AM or 10:30AM

| Clock           | Desc                                                                         |

Now it looks a bit more extreme since I'm forced to do WFH due to Covid-19 pandemic:

| Clock           | Desc                                                                         |

| 12:30PM         | Lunch break                                                                  |

Some of my friends say it's extreme because of my "laptop hour", they don't see game or movie time at all on my schedule. I've stopped doing game since I was in 6th semester college and stopped watching movies regularly since a few years ago, but hey my hobby project and working out keep me sane, it's my anchor that gives me motivation for the next day. I'd say it's not extreme at all, I know some people that work in consultancy and in the Big-4 accounting firm that work 60+ hours.

My youngest brother works in one of the Big-4 as an auditor, he just had 2 weeks of hell a month ago, slept only ~3-4 hours a day. I think they're superhuman able to work like that, physically and mentally tough people.
My day-to-day job now mostly manage a team, I consider myself lucky, I can still do programming at home.

At the end I just want to say that it's crucial to have something that motivates you to do more, whatever your schedule is, something that you do that other people don't have power to affect the outcome. Eventually you'll get that work life balance that you wanted to, either that or you're used to your schedule and it's the new "work-life balance" for you.
