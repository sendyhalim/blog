I often found myself typing file path manually when explaining code implementation and its use cases to my teammates.
The task to type file path manually is very daunting and I hate it so much when I mistyped.
The file path I mentioned is relative from project root. Let's say you have this structure


```swift
▾ Yomu/
  ▸ API/
  ▸ DataStructures/
  ▾ Screens/
  ┊ ▾ ChapterList/
  ┊ ┊ ┊ Chapter.swift
  ┊ ┊ ┊ ChapterCell.swift
  ┊ ┊ ┊ ChapterCell.xib
  ┊ ┊ ┊ ChapterCollectionHeader.swift
  ┊ ┊ ┊ ChapterCollectionHeader.xib
  ┊ ┊ ┊ ChapterCollectionViewController.swift
  ┊ ┊ ┊ ChapterCollectionViewController.xib
  ┊ ┊ ┊ ChapterCollectionViewModel.swift
  ┊ ┊ ┊ ChapterViewModel.swift
  ┊ ┊ ┊ ReadChapterRealm.swift
  ....
▸ YomuTests/
```

and you want to point out to someone an implementation in `ChapterViewModel.swift`, you would type this

```sh
Yomu/Screens/ChapterList/ChapterViewModel.swift
```

I did that a lot...

I knew there's a better way to do this.  There's a built-in function in vim that returns the relative path (from project root) of a file in active buffer.

```
expand('%')
```

Of course we can do better than that! It'll be handy if we can copy the file path to system clipboard.


```
" Register relative file path of current buffer
" from project root to system clipboard
nnoremap <F10> :let @+ = expand("%")<CR>
```

Now everytime you press `F10` in normal mode, it will automatically register file path to current active file
in buffer to your system clipboard.
