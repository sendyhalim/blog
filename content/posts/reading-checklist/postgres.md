I'm not a database expert, in my career I've faced so many issues and bottlenecks,
most of the come from database. My crystal ball ðŸ”® told me that it's just a matter of time
until the next database issues occur, so I decided to gather as much practical
database learning sources as I can in the past years, especially the ones that I think (based on experience)
will most likely be used.

We're using postgres at work so it's going to be tailored specifically to it,
the checklist should be read in order but nothing stops you to jump around.
