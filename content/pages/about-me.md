Hi, I'm Sendy Halim, I'm passionate about solving problems with tech, specifically
through software engineering. I randomly came across to software enginering when I was looking for
a new hobby during my 1st semester of my accounting degree, I completed my major though.

# About Software engineering
Writing code and software engineering is a hobby to me, it's an activity that
I enjoy the most. I don't know what's the reason, it's just I'm really into it.

Unfortunately I rarely write code at work nowadays, I'm putting my focus to
manage and grow teams of great software engineers, the low feeling of not writing code is paid half
everytime the teams ship features and bring more value to users, the other half is paid
when I write code in my sparetime 🤞.

# About Blogging
There are a couple of reasons why I started this blog:
* I want to document my thoughts based on my life, hobby projects, and profesional experience working in the software engineering field.
* I want to improve my writing skills.
